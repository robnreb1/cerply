## Technical Implementation

### Phase 1: Database Schema ✅

**Migration:** `api/drizzle/010_gamification.sql`

Created 5 new tables:

1. **learner_levels** - Track learner progression per track
   - Unique constraint: (user_id, track_id)
   - 5 levels: novice (0-20), learner (21-50), practitioner (51-100), expert (101-200), master (201+)

2. **certificates** - Issued certificates with Ed25519 signatures
   - Unique constraint: (user_id, track_id)
   - Includes: signature, pdf_url, verification_url

3. **badges** - Predefined achievement badges (5 seeded)
   - Speed Demon: 10 questions < 5 seconds
   - Perfectionist: 20 correct in a row
   - 7-Day Consistent: Daily streak
   - Knowledge Sharer: Share 3 artefacts
   - Lifelong Learner: Complete 5 tracks

4. **learner_badges** - Badges earned by learners
   - Unique constraint: (user_id, badge_id)

5. **manager_notifications** - Notifications for managers
   - Types: level_up, certificate, badge, at_risk
   - Filterable by read/unread status

**Drizzle Schema:** Updated `api/src/db/schema.ts` with TypeScript definitions for all tables

---

### Phase 2: Gamification Service ✅

**File:** `api/src/services/gamification.ts`

**Key Functions:**
- `calculateLevel(correctAttempts)` - Deterministic level calculation
- `getNextLevelInfo(correctAttempts)` - Progress toward next level
- `getLearnerLevel(userId, trackId)` - Current level with next level info
- `checkLevelUp(userId, trackId, newCorrectAttempts)` - Detect and persist level changes
- `countCorrectAttempts(userId, trackId)` - Track correct answers
- `getAllLearnerLevels(userId)` - All tracks for a learner

**Level Thresholds:**
```typescript
novice: 0-20 attempts
learner: 21-50 attempts
practitioner: 51-100 attempts
expert: 101-200 attempts
master: 201+ attempts
```

---

### Phase 3: Certificate Service ✅

**File:** `api/src/services/certificates.ts`

**Key Functions:**
- `generateCertificate(userId, trackId)` - Auto-generate on track completion
- `signCertificate(data)` - Ed25519 signature (mock for MVP)
- `verifyCertificate(certificateId, signature)` - Public verification
- `renderCertificatePDF(certificateId)` - PDF generation (text mock for MVP)
- `getUserCertificates(userId)` - List all certificates

**MVP Limitations:**
- Mock signature using Base64 encoding (awaiting `@noble/ed25519` installation)
- Text-based PDF (awaiting `pdfkit` installation)

**Production Ready:**
```bash
npm install pdfkit @types/pdfkit @noble/ed25519
# Then replace mock functions with real implementations
```

---

### Phase 4: Badge Detection Service ✅

**File:** `api/src/services/badges.ts`

**Key Functions:**
- `checkSpeedDemonBadge(userId)` - 10 questions < 5 seconds
- `checkPerfectionistBadge(userId)` - 20 correct streak
- `checkConsistentBadge(userId)` - 7-day daily streak
- `checkLifelongLearnerBadge(userId)` - 5 tracks completed
- `awardBadge(userId, badgeSlug)` - Idempotent badge awarding
- `detectAllBadges(userId)` - Run all checks, return newly awarded badges
- `getLearnerBadges(userId)` - Get earned badges with metadata
- `getAllBadges()` - Get all available badges

**Detection Timing:**
- Can be triggered after each attempt submission
- Can run as periodic cron job (hourly/daily)

**Note:** Knowledge Sharer badge requires shares tracking (deferred)

---

### Phase 5: Manager Notification Service ✅

**File:** `api/src/services/notifications.ts`

**Key Functions:**
- `notifyManager(event)` - Create in-app + email notification
- `getLearnerManager(learnerId)` - Find learner's manager
- `getManagerNotifications(managerId, unreadOnly, limit)` - Fetch notifications
- `markNotificationRead(notificationId, managerId)` - Update read status
- `getUnreadCount(managerId)` - Count unread notifications

**Notification Types:**
- `level_up` - Learner progressed to new level
- `certificate` - Learner earned certificate
- `badge` - Learner unlocked badge
- `at_risk` - Learner needs support

**Email Support:**
- Mock email logging for dev (no SendGrid key required)
- Production: Requires `SENDGRID_API_KEY` environment variable

**Preferences:**
- MVP: Default to 'immediate' notifications
- Future: User preferences table for daily/weekly/off

---

### Phase 6: API Routes ✅

**File:** `api/src/routes/gamification.ts`

Implemented 7 API endpoints with full RBAC:

## Known Limitations (MVP)

1. **Certificate Signatures:** Mock implementation (Base64 encoding)
   - **Why:** Awaiting `@noble/ed25519` npm package installation
   - **Impact:** Certificates not cryptographically verifiable
   - **Fix:** Install dependency and update `signCertificate()` function

2. **PDF Generation:** Text-based mock PDFs
   - **Why:** Awaiting `pdfkit` npm package installation
   - **Impact:** Certificates not visually formatted
   - **Fix:** Install dependency and update `renderCertificatePDF()` function

3. **Email Notifications:** Console logging only
   - **Why:** No SendGrid API key configured
   - **Impact:** Managers don't receive email alerts
   - **Fix:** Configure `SENDGRID_API_KEY` environment variable

4. **Daily/Weekly Digests:** Not implemented
   - **Why:** Phase 5.5 deferred for MVP
   - **Impact:** Managers only get immediate notifications
   - **Fix:** Implement `notificationDigest.ts` with node-cron

5. **Badge: Knowledge Sharer:** Partially implemented
   - **Why:** Requires shares tracking not yet built
   - **Impact:** Badge never awarded
   - **Fix:** Add shares table and tracking in future epic

6. **Web UI:** Not implemented
   - **Why:** Phase 7 deferred to focus on API completion
   - **Impact:** No visual interface for gamification features
   - **Fix:** Build React components in Phase 2

## Conclusion

Epic 7 core API implementation is **complete and ready for testing**. The gamification system foundation is solid, with all database tables, services, and API routes implemented and tested. The system is designed to scale and can be enhanced with production dependencies and UI components in Phase 2.

**Recommendation:** Merge to staging, run UAT, install production dependencies, and begin UI development in parallel.
