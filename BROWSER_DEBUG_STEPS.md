# Browser Debugging Steps

## The browser isn't sending requests to the server. Let's debug:

### Step 1: Open Browser Console
1. In the browser at http://localhost:3000
2. Press **F12** or **Cmd+Option+I** (Mac) to open DevTools
3. Click on the **Console** tab
4. Click on the **Network** tab as well

### Step 2: Clear Everything
1. In Console tab: Right-click â†’ "Clear console"
2. In Network tab: Click the ðŸš« icon to clear
3. Make sure "Preserve log" is checked in Network tab

### Step 3: Try Again
1. Type: "I want to be a successful entrepreneur"
2. Click Send
3. Watch the Console and Network tabs

### Step 4: Look For:

**In Console tab - look for RED errors like:**
- `TypeError: Failed to fetch`
- `CORS error`
- `x-admin-token`
- Any JavaScript errors

**In Network tab - look for:**
- A request to `content/understand` (click on it)
- What status code? (should be 200, might be 401, 500, or failed)
- Click on it and check the "Response" tab

### Step 5: Screenshot
Take a screenshot of:
1. The Console tab (showing any red errors)
2. The Network tab (showing the request to content/understand)

## Quick Fix to Try First:

### Option A: Force Refresh Service Worker
1. Go to: chrome://serviceworker-internals/ (or brave://serviceworker-internals/)
2. Find localhost:3000
3. Click "Unregister"
4. Close ALL browser tabs of localhost:3000
5. Open fresh: http://localhost:3000

### Option B: Clear Site Data
1. F12 â†’ Application tab
2. Left side: "Storage" â†’ "Clear site data"
3. Click "Clear site data" button
4. Close and reopen tab

### Option C: Try Different Browser
If all else fails, try Firefox or Safari to rule out browser caching issues.

## Most Likely Issues:

1. **Service Worker caching old code** â†’ Clear as above
2. **Browser cached old JS bundle** â†’ Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
3. **CORS/proxy issue** â†’ Check console for errors
4. **Admin token mismatch** â†’ Check network request headers

**Please try Option A or B first, then test again!**
