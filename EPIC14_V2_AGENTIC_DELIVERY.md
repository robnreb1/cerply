# Epic 14 v2.0: AI-First Conversational Module Builder - AGENTIC IMPLEMENTATION

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (Refactored to Agentic Architecture)  
**Version:** 2.0.1 (Agentic Refactor)  
**Delivery Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Epic Priority:** P0 (MVP-CRITICAL)

---

## 🎯 Critical Update: Agentic, Not Deterministic

**User Requirement:**
> "I want to ensure that is agentic and natural, not deterministic and clunky. It took a long time to address this point on the Learner pages, I would like to shortcut to that outcome for manager interactions."

**What Changed:**
- ❌ **REMOVED:** Keyword matching (`if (content.includes('train'))`)
- ❌ **REMOVED:** Fixed question sequences (form-like)
- ❌ **REMOVED:** Hardcoded logic trees
- ✅ **ADDED:** LLM-driven understanding via GPT-4
- ✅ **ADDED:** Comprehensive system prompt (60+ lines)
- ✅ **ADDED:** Loop-guard to prevent repeated questions
- ✅ **ADDED:** Contextual inference and natural flow

---

## 🏗️ Architecture: Agentic Implementation

### Before (v2.0.0 - Deterministic):
```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Keyword matching
function extractCollectedInfo(history: ConversationTurn[]): CollectedInfo {
  if (content.includes('beginner')) info.currentLevel = 'beginner';
  if (content.includes('train')) info.topic = 'detected';
  // ... more keyword matching
}
```

### After (v2.0.1 - Agentic):
```typescript
// ✅ GOOD: LLM-driven
export async function moduleCreationAgent(ctx: ModuleCreationContext): Promise<AgentResponse> {
  const response = await callJSON({
    system: MANAGER_MODULE_CREATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT, // 60+ line personality definition
    user: conversationContext,
    model: 'gpt-4o', // Capable model for nuanced understanding
  });
  
  // Loop-guard prevents repeated questions
  if (parsed.clarifying_questions) {
    const filtered = filterRepeatedQuestions(
      ctx.conversationId,
      parsed.clarifying_questions,
      ctx.conversationHistory
    );
    // If all questions filtered (already asked), generate preview
    if (filtered.length === 0) {
      return generatePreview(ctx);
    }
  }
}
```

---

## ✅ Agentic Implementation Checklist

### **1. System Prompt (60+ lines)** ✅
- Comprehensive personality definition
- Natural conversation guidelines
- Context inference rules
- Example conversation flows
- JSON response format specification

**Key Excerpt:**
```
You are Cerply, an expert instructional designer and learning consultant...

Be adaptive and intelligent, not rigid:
- DON'T ask all questions at once (feels like a form)
- DO infer from context when possible
- Example: If manager says "I need to train my sales team on our new pricing model"
  * You already know: Topic = pricing, Audience = sales team
  * You can infer: They likely have proprietary pricing docs
  * Only ask: "Do you have internal pricing documents?"
```

### **2. LLM-Driven Classification** ✅
- Intent understanding via GPT-4
- No keyword matching in critical paths
- Contextual inference from full conversation history

### **3. Loop-Guard** ✅
- Prevents asking the same question twice
- Uses word overlap similarity (50% threshold)
- Filters repeated questions before responding
- Falls back to preview generation if all questions filtered

**Implementation:**
```typescript
function hasAskedBefore(conversationId: string, question: string, conversationHistory: ConversationTurn[]): boolean {
  const agentQuestions = conversationHistory.filter(t => t.role === 'agent').map(t => t.content.toLowerCase());
  const questionLower = question.toLowerCase();
  
  // Check exact substring match
  for (const prevQ of agentQuestions) {
    if (prevQ.includes(questionLower)) return true;
  }
  
  // Check semantic similarity
  const qWords = new Set(questionLower.split(/\s+/).filter(w => w.length > 3));
  for (const prevQ of agentQuestions) {
    const prevWords = new Set(prevQ.split(/\s+/).filter(w => w.length > 3));
    const intersection = new Set([...qWords].filter(w => prevWords.has(w)));
    const similarity = intersection.size / Math.max(qWords.size, prevWords.size);
    if (similarity > 0.5) return true; // 50% overlap = too similar
  }
  return false;
}
```

### **4. Natural Conversation Flow** ✅
- Agent asks MAX 2 questions at a time (not all at once)
- Generates preview when enough info collected
- Handles refinements naturally ("add section on X")
- Uses "we" language and encouraging tone

### **5. Contextual Inference** ✅
- "I need to train my sales team on pricing" → Agent knows: topic=pricing, audience=sales
- Only asks about: proprietary docs, deadline
- Doesn't ask obvious questions like "what's the topic?"

---

## 🧪 Testing: The "Natural Flow" Scenario

### Test Script:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/curator/modules/conversation \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-admin-token: test-admin-token" \
  -d '{
    "userMessage": "I need to train my sales team on our new product pricing model"
  }'
```

**Expected Agent Behavior:**
1. **Infers context:** Topic = pricing, Audience = sales team
2. **Asks smart questions:** "Do you have internal pricing documents?" (not "what topic?")
3. **Next turn:** Manager: "Yes, I'll upload our deck. They're experienced, need them ready by Jan 15"
4. **Agent generates preview immediately** (has all info: topic, audience, deadline, proprietary content)
5. **No repeated questions** (loop-guard working)

### Manual Validation:
**✅ PASS if:**
- Agent doesn't ask "what topic?" when topic is clear from context
- Agent doesn't repeat questions already answered
- Conversation feels like talking to a consultant, not filling a form
- Agent generates preview when it has enough info (doesn't keep asking)

**❌ FAIL if:**
- Agent uses keyword matching (search for `.includes(` in agent logic)
- Agent asks all questions at once (form-like)
- Agent repeats questions (loop-guard broken)
- Conversation feels robotic or clunky

---

## 📦 Refactored Files

### Core Changes:
1. **`api/src/services/module-creation-agent.ts`** - Completely refactored
   - Added 60+ line system prompt
   - LLM-driven understanding via `callJSON()`
   - Loop-guard implementation
   - Removed all keyword matching
   - Removed hardcoded question sequences

2. **`api/src/routes/manager-modules.ts`** - No changes needed

   - Passes full conversation history as context

3. **`web/app/curator/modules/new/page.tsx`** - No changes needed
   - Already chat-based UI (not form-based)
   - Already supports inline file upload
   - Already embeds module preview in conversation

## 🔍 Code Review: No Deterministic Logic

### Searched for Anti-Patterns:
```bash
# ❌ Check for keyword matching
grep -r "\.includes\(" api/src/services/module-creation-agent.ts
# Result: NONE in agent logic (only in loop-guard for deduplication)

# ❌ Check for string length checks
grep -r "content\.length >" api/src/services/module-creation-agent.ts
# Result: NONE

# ✅ Verify LLM call exists
grep -r "callJSON" api/src/services/module-creation-agent.ts
# Result: FOUND in moduleCreationAgent()

# ✅ Verify system prompt exists
grep -r "MANAGER_MODULE_CREATION_SYSTEM_PROMPT" api/src/services/module-creation-agent.ts
# Result: FOUND (60+ lines)

# ✅ Verify loop-guard exists
grep -r "hasAskedBefore" api/src/services/module-creation-agent.ts
# Result: FOUND
```

### Expected Behavior:
1. **Turn 1:** Manager: "I need to train my sales team on pricing"
   - Agent infers: topic=pricing, audience=sales
   - Agent asks: "Do you have internal docs?" (smart, not obvious)

2. **Turn 2:** Manager: "Yes, experienced sellers, need it by Jan 15"
   - Agent generates preview immediately (has all info)
   - Preview shows: proprietary section (🔒) + public research (🌐)

3. **Turn 3:** Manager: "Add a section on objection handling"
   - Agent updates preview naturally
   - No repeated questions (loop-guard working)

## ✨ What Makes This Agentic

### 1. **LLM-Driven Understanding**
```typescript
// Agent "thinks" using GPT-4, not keyword matching
const response = await callJSON({
  system: COMPREHENSIVE_SYSTEM_PROMPT,
  user: conversationContext,
  model: 'gpt-4o',
});
```

### 2. **Contextual Inference**
```
Manager: "I need to train my sales team on our new pricing model"

Agent (Smart Inference):
✓ Topic: pricing model
✓ Audience: sales team
✓ Likely needs: proprietary pricing docs
✗ Doesn't ask: "What topic?" (already knows!)
→ Only asks: "Do you have internal pricing documents?"
```

### 3. **Natural Refinement**
```
Manager: "Add a section on handling objections"

Agent (Natural Understanding):
✓ Understands: This is a refinement request
✓ Action: Update content_blocks array
✗ Doesn't: Trigger keyword like `if (input.includes('add'))`
→ LLM parses intent and updates preview
```

### 4. **Loop-Guard**
```
Turn 1: Agent asks: "What's your team's experience level?"
Turn 3: Agent might ask: "What experience level are they?"

Loop-Guard: ❌ Blocks second question (50% word overlap with turn 1)
Result: Agent skips to preview generation instead
```
