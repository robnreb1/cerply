# ✅ Epic 14: Manager Module Workflows - Implementation Complete

**Status:** DONE ✓  
**Priority:** P0 (MVP-CRITICAL)  
**Completed:** October 17, 2025

---

## 🎯 What Was Built

Epic 14 delivers the **critical manager workflows** that enable Cerply's core value proposition:

1. ✅ **Create** training modules from topics
2. ✅ **Refine** content with company-specific information
3. ✅ **Assign** modules to teams with role-based filtering
4. ✅ **Track** team progress and performance

This is the **missing piece** that connects content generation (Epic 6) with learner delivery, enabling managers to drive team training.

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Database Required:** Migration needs active DATABASE_URL
2. **Topic Dependency:** Modules require existing topics
3. **User ID Type:** Mixed UUID/TEXT for compatibility
4. **Pagination:** Not implemented (future enhancement)

These are expected and documented with workarounds.

- [ ] Create module from UI
- [ ] Add proprietary content
- [ ] Assign to multiple teams
- [ ] Filter by role
- [ ] View analytics dashboard
- [ ] Verify overdue highlighting
- [ ] Check completion rate calculations
- [ ] Test access control (non-manager shouldn't access)

---

## 🎓 User Documentation Needed

These should be created by product team:
- [ ] Manager user guide (screenshots + walkthrough)
- [ ] Video tutorial (module creation flow)
- [ ] FAQ (common questions)
- [ ] Best practices guide (content curation tips)

---

## 🚢 Deployment Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [x] Database migration created
- [x] API routes implemented
- [x] UI components built

### Deployment Steps
1. Run migration: `npm run migrate`
2. Deploy API with new routes
3. Deploy web with new pages
4. Verify `/curator/modules` is accessible
