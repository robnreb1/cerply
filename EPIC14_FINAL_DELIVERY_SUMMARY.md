## 🎯 Feature Breakdown

### 1. Difficulty Level
**Use Case**: Help learners choose appropriate content

**Manager Action**:
```bash
# Create module with difficulty
curl -X POST /api/curator/modules/create \
  -d '{"title": "Advanced TypeScript", "difficultyLevel": "advanced"}'

# Update difficulty  
curl -X PUT /api/curator/modules/{id} \
  -d '{"difficultyLevel": "expert"}'
```

**Business Value**: Learners avoid frustration from content that's too hard/easy

---

### 2. Pause/Unpause
**Use Case**: Protect learners from problematic content

**Manager Action**:
```bash
# Pause a module with issues
curl -X POST /api/curator/modules/{id}/pause

# Resume when fixed
curl -X POST /api/curator/modules/{id}/unpause
```

**Business Value**: Managers can quickly react to content quality issues

---

### 3. Question Performance Tracking
**Use Case**: Data-driven content improvements

**Manager View**:
```json
{
  "questionStats": [
    {
      "questionId": "uuid",
      "attemptsCount": 150,
      "successRate": 0.45,  // 45% success = too hard
      "avgTimeSeconds": 120,
      "perceivedDifficulty": "too_hard",
      "skipCount": 25,
      "hintRequestsCount": 40
    }
  ]
}
```

**Business Value**: Identify which questions need editing/removal

---

## 🔄 Integration Points

### For Epic 15 (Learner Experience)
The question stats service is ready to integrate:

```typescript
import { recordQuestionAttempt } from '../services/question-stats';

// After scoring a question
await recordQuestionAttempt({
  questionId,
  moduleId,
  wasCorrect: score.correct,
  timeSeconds: elapsed,
  wasSkipped: false,
  hintRequested: hintsUsed > 0,
});
```

This automatically:
- Updates attempt/success counts
- Recalculates success rate
- Adjusts perceived difficulty  
- Tracks engagement metrics

---

## ⏳ Post-MVP Features (Documented)

### Learning Partner Role
**Scope**: Role variant similar to manager but can't assign content
**Effort**: ~1 day (RBAC + permission gates)
**Priority**: P2 - Nice to have

### Auto Content Refresh
**Scope**: Monitor sources, generate AI diffs, notify managers
**Effort**: ~2 weeks (source monitoring + AI integration)
**Priority**: P2 - Innovation feature
