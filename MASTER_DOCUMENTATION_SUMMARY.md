## Traceability Achieved

### Document Cross-References

```
ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md
  ‚îú‚îÄ References: BRD (every principle), FSD (examples)
  ‚îî‚îÄ Referenced by: EPIC_MASTER_PLAN, AGENT_WORKFLOW, all prompts

EPIC_MASTER_PLAN.md
  ‚îú‚îÄ References: BRD (every epic), FSD (every epic), ADR
  ‚îî‚îÄ Referenced by: All implementation prompts, AGENT_WORKFLOW

IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md
  ‚îú‚îÄ References: ADR, EPIC_MASTER_PLAN, BRD, FSD
  ‚îî‚îÄ Referenced by: Future prompts (Epic 6.6, 6.7, 10-12)

AGENT_WORKFLOW.md
  ‚îú‚îÄ References: ADR, EPIC_MASTER_PLAN, BRD, FSD, prompts
  ‚îî‚îÄ Referenced by: All agents (mandatory reading)

BRD (docs/brd/cerply-brd.md)
  ‚îú‚îÄ References: MVP Roadmap
  ‚îî‚îÄ Referenced by: ADR, EPIC_MASTER_PLAN, all prompts

FSD (docs/functional-spec.md)
  ‚îú‚îÄ References: BRD
  ‚îî‚îÄ Referenced by: ADR, EPIC_MASTER_PLAN, all prompts
```

**Result:** Complete traceability chain from BRD ‚Üí FSD ‚Üí Epic Plan ‚Üí ADR ‚Üí Prompts ‚Üí Code

## What's Pending (Awaiting Your Review)

### Phase 5: Reconcile Existing Prompts

The following 5 implementation prompts need updates:

1. **EPIC5_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md** (Slack Integration)
2. **EPIC6_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md** (Ensemble Generation)
3. **EPIC7_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md** (Gamification)
4. **EPIC8_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md** (Conversational UI)
5. **EPIC9_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md** (Adaptive Difficulty)

**Required Changes Per Prompt:**
- Add STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS section at top (before Table of Contents)
- Add Traceability Matrix section (after Project Context)
- Update References section to include ADR and Epic Plan
- Verify alignment with locked scope in Epic Master Plan

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 hours (30-40 min per prompt)

---

## How to Proceed

### Option 1: I Update All 5 Prompts Now
**Pros:** Complete consistency, immediate usability  
**Cons:** Large changes to existing prompts (may need review)

### Option 2: You Review Master Docs First, Then I Update Prompts
**Pros:** You validate governance structure before rollout  
**Cons:** Delay in full consistency

### Option 3: Update Prompts Incrementally (As Needed)
**Pros:** Only update when epic is actively being worked on  
**Cons:** Risk of agents using old prompts without statutory requirements

## Impact on Future Development

### Before Master Documentation Lock
‚ùå Agents start coding without reading principles  
‚ùå Scope drift between agents  
‚ùå Inconsistent patterns across epics  
‚ùå No traceability to BRD/FSD  
‚ùå Difficult to onboard new agents  

### After Master Documentation Lock
‚úÖ All agents read ADR + Epic Plan first (2-3 hours)  
‚úÖ Scope locked in Epic Master Plan (no drift)  
‚úÖ Consistent patterns enforced by ADR  
‚úÖ Full traceability: BRD ‚Üí FSD ‚Üí Epic ‚Üí Code  
‚úÖ New agents follow AGENT_WORKFLOW.md (clear path)

## Next Steps

1. **You Review:** Review the 4 master documents (30-60 min)
2. **You Approve/Modify:** Approve as-is or request changes
3. **I Update Prompts:** Update 5 existing prompts with statutory requirements
4. **I Verify Cross-References:** Final check of all traceability chains
5. **You Lock:** Confirm v1.0 LOCKED status for ADR and Epic Plan

---

## Questions for You

1. **Do the master documents capture all critical architectural decisions?**
   - Are there any patterns missing from ADR?
   - Are there any conventions you want to lock down?

2. **Is the Epic Master Plan accurate?**
   - Are the BRD/FSD mappings correct?
   - Is the scope for each epic locked correctly?
   - Are there any missing dependencies?

3. **Should I proceed with updating the 5 existing prompts?**
   - Option 1: Update all now (2-3 hours)
   - Option 2: Wait for your review
   - Option 3: Update incrementally as needed

4. **Any changes needed before locking to v1.0?**
   - ADR version 1.0?
   - Epic Master Plan version 1.0?
   - Or do you want to iterate first?
