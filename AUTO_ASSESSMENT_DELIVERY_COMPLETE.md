# ✅ Auto-Assessment Delivery Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-06  
**Epic:** Learner MVP – Auto-assessment & Adaptive Scheduling  
**Status:** 🎉 **COMPLETE & READY FOR STAGING**

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully transformed Cerply from **self-grading** to **system-inferred mastery** – a fundamental shift that aligns with our core promise of adaptive learning. The system now observes learner behavior (correctness, latency, hints, retries) and automatically adjusts difficulty.

**Key Achievement:** Zero reliance on subjective self-assessment. True adaptive mastery.

---

## What Was Delivered

### 1. API Transformation (Complete)

**Extended POST /api/score:**
- Returns `{ correct, difficulty, explain, next_hint, diagnostics }`
- Auto-determines correctness from answer comparison
- Infers difficulty from latency + hint count (fast→easy, slow→hard)
- Auto-provides explanation if wrong OR slow (>20s)

**Updated POST /api/certified/progress:**
- Accepts new `action: 'submit'` with telemetry:
  ```typescript
  result: {
    correct: boolean,
    latency_ms: number,
    item_difficulty: 'easy'|'medium'|'hard',
    item_type: 'mcq'|'free'|'card',
    hint_count: number,
    retry_count: number
  }
  ```
- Backward compatible: Still accepts `action: 'grade'` (logs deprecation)
- Converts telemetry to SM2 grades (5=fast+correct, 1=wrong+hints)

**Adaptive GET /api/daily/next:**
- **Auto-ease:** 2× incorrect + latency >30s → drop difficulty
- **Auto-step-up:** 3× correct + latency <10s + no hints → raise difficulty
- **Never-repeat-verbatim:** Paraphrase variants (3 per item)
- Returns: `{ queue, assigned_difficulty, adaptation_reason }`

**In-memory learner state:**
- Per-session tracking (sliding window N=5)
- Adaptive thresholds trigger automatically
- Never-repeat tracking (seen_items Set)

### 2. Web UI Transformation (Complete)

**Removed:**
- ❌ All self-grade buttons (1-5 scale)
- ❌ "How well did you know this?" text
- ❌ Any self-assessment UI

**Added:**
- ✅ Answer text input (auto-assessed)
- ✅ "Submit Answer" button
- ✅ Latency tracking (flipTimestamp → latency_ms)
- ✅ Instant correctness feedback (✓ Correct / ✗ Not quite)
- ✅ Auto-show explanation if wrong OR slow (>20s)
- ✅ Adaptation feedback chips ("🚀 Great mastery!" / "💡 Let's ease off")
- ✅ Real-time accuracy in HUD (e.g., "85% correct")

### 3. Comprehensive Test Suite (Complete)

**E2E Tests (13 scenarios):**
- `web/e2e/learner-auto-assessment.spec.ts`
- Critical: AA-1 verifies NO self-grade buttons anywhere
- Covers: submit flow, auto-explain, latency, telemetry, HUD updates
- Edge cases: empty answers, long answers, rapid clicks
- Keyboard navigation validated

**Smoke Script (10 assertions):**
- `api/scripts/smoke-adaptive.sh`
- Tests API thresholds (fast→easy, slow→hard)
- Validates telemetry structure
- Checks backward compatibility
- Verifies paraphrase variants

**UAT Documentation:**
- `docs/uat/LEARNER_MVP_UAT_AUTO_ASSESSMENT.md`
- 10 stakeholder scenarios with step-by-step instructions
- DevTools validation included
- Feedback template provided

### 4. Technical Documentation (Complete)

**`TECH_NOTES_adaptive-heuristic.md`:**
- Detailed threshold explanations
- Sliding window rationale (N=5)
- SM2 grade conversion table
- BKT/AFM/DKT roadmap for future

**`docs/uat/LEARNER_AUTO_ASSESSMENT_WHAT_CHANGED.md`:**
- User-facing changes summary
- Before/after flow comparison
- FAQs for learners
- Rollout plan

## Adaptive Thresholds

### Auto-Ease (Drop Difficulty)
**Trigger:** 2 consecutive incorrect at same difficulty with latency >30s

**Action:**
- `hard` → `medium`
- `medium` → `easy`
- Show: "💡 Let's ease off a bit and build confidence"

### Auto-Step-Up (Raise Difficulty)
**Trigger:** 3 consecutive correct with latency <10s and no hints

**Action:**
- `easy` → `medium`
- `medium` → `hard`
- Show: "🚀 Great mastery! Increasing challenge..."

### Never-Repeat-Verbatim
**Implementation:** 3 paraphrase variants per item, deterministic rotation

**Example:**
1. "What is spaced repetition?"
2. "Define spaced repetition"
3. "Explain the concept of spaced repetition"

## Known Limitations (MVP Scope)

1. **Paraphrase variants:** Deterministic stubs (not LLM-generated)
2. **Adaptive thresholds:** Heuristic (not ML-based BKT/AFM)
3. **Learner state:** In-memory only (resets on process restart)
4. **Correctness inference:** Simple string comparison (not semantic similarity)

**Future work:** See `TECH_NOTES_adaptive-heuristic.md` for BKT/AFM/DKT roadmap.
