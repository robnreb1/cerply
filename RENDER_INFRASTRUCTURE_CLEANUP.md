# Render Infrastructure Cleanup Assessment

**Date:** 2025-10-06  
**Issue:** Legacy blueprint creating duplicate/conflicting services  
**Status:** Production working, but cleanup needed

## üîç Current Infrastructure

### Services Identified

| Service Name | Type | Runtime | Managed By | Branch | Purpose | Status |
|-------------|------|---------|------------|--------|---------|--------|
| **cerply-api-prod** | Web Service | Image | Manual | main? | Production API | ‚úÖ Active |
| **cerply-api** | Web Service | Node | Blueprint: cerply-staging | staging | Staging API (blueprint-managed) | ‚ö†Ô∏è Duplicate |
| **cerply-api:staging-latest** | Web Service | Image | ? | staging | Staging API? | ‚ö†Ô∏è Duplicate |

### Blueprints

| Blueprint Name | Repo | Branch | Resources | Status |
|---------------|------|--------|-----------|--------|
| **cerply-staging** | robnreb1/cerply | staging | cerply-api service | ‚ö†Ô∏è Active (creates duplicates) |

### DNS/URLs

| URL | Points To | Env Vars Status |
|-----|-----------|-----------------|
| `https://api.cerply.com` | cerply-api-prod | ‚úÖ RETENTION_ENABLED=true, CERTIFIED_ENABLED=true |
| `https://cerply-api-staging-latest.onrender.com` | cerply-api:staging-latest? | ‚úÖ Has env vars (from previous work) |

---

## üêõ Problems Identified

### 1. Blueprint Auto-Recreation Issue
**Problem:** The `cerply-staging` blueprint automatically recreates the `cerply-api` service when the `staging` branch is updated.

**Evidence:**
- User reports: "when I hover over it it says that it is managed by 'cerply-staging'"
- Blueprint defined in `render.yaml` at repo root
- Service appears as "1h old" (recently recreated)

**Impact:**
- Creates confusion about which service is "staging"
- Wastes resources (duplicate services running)
- Updates to `render.yaml` trigger service recreation
- Potential for wrong service to be called

### 2. Duplicate Staging Services
**Problem:** Two staging services exist:
- `cerply-api` (Node, blueprint-managed)
- `cerply-api:staging-latest` (Image)

**Questions:**
- Which one is actually used?
- Which has the correct env vars?
- Which should be kept?

### 3. Inconsistent Deployment Model
**Problem:** Mixed deployment approaches:
- Production: Manual service (`cerply-api-prod`)
- Staging: Blueprint-managed (`cerply-api` via `cerply-staging` blueprint)
- Staging: Separate image service? (`cerply-api:staging-latest`)

**Impact:**
- Confusion about how to deploy updates
- Environment variable updates need to be applied multiple times
- CI/CD unclear (which service gets updated?)

### 4. render.yaml Out of Sync
**Problem:** The `render.yaml` file defines a blueprint for staging, but:
- It only defines one service (`cerply-api`)
- It doesn't define production
- Environment variables added to `render.yaml` only affect blueprint-managed services
- Manual services (like `cerply-api-prod`) aren't affected by `render.yaml`

---

## ‚úÖ Recommended Cleanup Plan

### Phase 1: Immediate (Verify Current State)

**Goal:** Confirm which services are actually in use and have correct configuration.

**Steps:**

1. **Identify which service handles staging API:**
   ```bash
   # Test both staging URLs
   curl https://cerply-api-staging-latest.onrender.com/api/health
   curl https://cerply-api.onrender.com/api/health  # If accessible
   
   # Check which has retention enabled
   curl -X POST https://cerply-api-staging-latest.onrender.com/api/certified/schedule \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"session_id":"test","plan_id":"demo","items":[{"id":"c1","front":"Q","back":"A"}]}'
   ```

2. **Check production DNS:**
   ```bash
   nslookup api.cerply.com
   # Should point to cerply-api-prod
   ```

3. **Verify web app is now working:**
   - Visit: https://cerply-web.vercel.app/certified/study
   - Click "Start Study Session"
   - Expected: ‚úÖ Works (no "Retention preview disabled" error)

### Phase 2: Remove Blueprint (Recommended)

**Goal:** Stop the blueprint from auto-creating services.

**Why:** Blueprints are useful for replicating infrastructure, but here they're causing confusion and duplicates.

**Steps:**

1. **Delete the `cerply-staging` blueprint:**
   - Go to Render Dashboard ‚Üí Blueprints
   - Find `cerply-staging`
   - Click "Delete blueprint"
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** Choose "Delete blueprint only, keep services" (if prompted)

2. **Decide on staging service:**
   - **Option A:** Keep `cerply-api:staging-latest` (image-based, consistent with prod)
   - **Option B:** Keep `cerply-api` (Node-based, faster rebuilds)
   - **Recommended:** Option A (image-based for consistency)

3. **Delete unused staging service:**
   - If keeping `cerply-api:staging-latest`, delete `cerply-api`
   - If keeping `cerply-api`, delete `cerply-api:staging-latest`

4. **Remove or update `render.yaml`:**
   - **Option A:** Delete `render.yaml` (no longer needed)
   - **Option B:** Update to document config only (add comments stating it's not active)

### Phase 3: Standardize Deployment Model

**Goal:** Clear, consistent deployment approach.

**Recommended Model:**

```
Production:
  Service: cerply-api-prod
  Branch: main (or prod)
  Deploy: Auto-deploy on push to main
  URL: https://api.cerply.com
  Env Vars: Set via Render dashboard

Staging:
  Service: cerply-api-staging (rename cerply-api:staging-latest)
  Branch: staging
  Deploy: Auto-deploy on push to staging
  URL: https://cerply-api-staging.onrender.com (or similar)
  Env Vars: Set via Render dashboard
```

**Steps:**

1. **Rename staging service** (if using `cerply-api:staging-latest`):
   - Go to service settings
   - Rename to `cerply-api-staging` (clearer name)

2. **Configure auto-deploy:**
   - Production: Watches `main` branch
   - Staging: Watches `staging` branch

3. **Document environment variables:**
   - Create `docs/deploy/render-env-vars.md`
   - List all required env vars for prod and staging
   - Include setup instructions

4. **Update web app environment:**
   - Vercel production: Uses `https://api.cerply.com` (default)
   - Vercel preview: Could use staging API (optional)

### Phase 4: Update Documentation

**Goal:** Prevent future confusion.

**Files to Update:**

1. **`docs/deploy/RENDER_SETUP.md`** (create):
   ```markdown
   # Render Deployment Setup
   
   ## Services
   
   ### Production: cerply-api-prod
   - Branch: main
   - URL: https://api.cerply.com
   - Runtime: Docker image
   - Env vars: [list]
   
   ### Staging: cerply-api-staging
   - Branch: staging
   - URL: https://cerply-api-staging.onrender.com
   - Runtime: Docker image
   - Env vars: [list]
   
   ## Deployment Process
   
   1. Merge to staging ‚Üí triggers staging deploy
   2. Test on staging
   3. Merge staging to main ‚Üí triggers prod deploy
   4. Verify prod
   
   ## Environment Variables
   
   Required for both services:
   - CERTIFIED_ENABLED=true
   - RETENTION_ENABLED=true
   - [others...]
   ```

2. **`render.yaml`** - Delete or add header:
   ```yaml
   # DEPRECATED: Blueprint removed to avoid service duplication
   # Services are now managed directly in Render dashboard
   # See docs/deploy/RENDER_SETUP.md for deployment instructions
   ```

3. **`README.md`** - Update deployment section

---

## üéØ Quick Win: Minimal Cleanup (If Short on Time)

**Goal:** Stop duplicates without major changes.

**Steps:**

1. **Delete the `cerply-staging` blueprint:**
   - Prevents future auto-creation
   - Keep existing services running

2. **Add comment to `render.yaml`:**
   ```yaml
   # NOTE: This file is not actively used
   # Blueprint was removed to prevent service duplication
   # Services are managed directly in Render dashboard
   ```

3. **Verify both production and staging have env vars:**
   - `cerply-api-prod`: ‚úÖ Already added
   - `cerply-api` or `cerply-api:staging-latest`: Check and add if missing

4. **Test both environments:**
   - Production: https://cerply-web.vercel.app/certified/study
   - Staging: (if you have a staging web deployment)

## üö¶ Decision Matrix

### Should You Delete the Blueprint?

| Scenario | Keep Blueprint? | Rationale |
|----------|----------------|-----------|
| Manual service management preferred | ‚ùå No | Blueprints add complexity when not needed |
| Want Infrastructure-as-Code | ‚úÖ Maybe | But need to fix duplicates issue |
| Frequently replicate environments | ‚úÖ Yes | Blueprints useful for this |
| Simple two-service setup (prod + staging) | ‚ùå No | Manual management simpler |

**Recommendation for Cerply:** ‚ùå **Delete the blueprint**
- Only 2 environments (prod + staging)
- Services already exist and working
- Blueprint causing confusion/duplicates
- Manual management is simpler for this scale

---

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

**After cleanup, the following should be true:**

### Infrastructure
- [ ] Only 2 active API services: production + staging
- [ ] No duplicate services
- [ ] No active blueprints (or blueprint clearly documented)
- [ ] Service names are clear (e.g., `cerply-api-prod`, `cerply-api-staging`)

### Configuration
- [ ] Both services have `CERTIFIED_ENABLED=true`
- [ ] Both services have `RETENTION_ENABLED=true`
- [ ] Auto-deploy configured correctly (main ‚Üí prod, staging ‚Üí staging)

### Documentation
- [ ] Deployment process documented
- [ ] Environment variables documented
- [ ] `render.yaml` status clarified (deleted or deprecated)

### Functionality
- [ ] Production API works: `https://api.cerply.com/api/certified/schedule` ‚Üí 200
- [ ] Staging API works: `https://[staging-url]/api/certified/schedule` ‚Üí 200
- [ ] Web app works: `/certified/study` page functional

---

## üìã Execution Checklist

Use this when performing cleanup:

### Pre-Cleanup
- [ ] Backup current service configurations (screenshot env vars)
- [ ] Note current URLs for production and staging
- [ ] Verify production is working (web page test)
- [ ] Identify which staging service is actually used

### Cleanup
- [ ] Delete `cerply-staging` blueprint (keep services)
- [ ] Delete unused staging service (whichever isn't used)
- [ ] Rename remaining staging service to `cerply-api-staging`
- [ ] Verify both services have required env vars
- [ ] Update or delete `render.yaml`

### Post-Cleanup
- [ ] Test production API endpoint
- [ ] Test staging API endpoint (if used)
- [ ] Test web app `/certified/study` page
- [ ] Update deployment documentation
- [ ] Commit documentation changes

### Final Verification
- [ ] No service duplication in Render dashboard
- [ ] Clear understanding of which service is which
- [ ] Deployment process documented
- [ ] Team informed of changes

## üÜò Rollback Plan

**If cleanup causes issues:**

1. **Services are still running** (deleting blueprint doesn't delete services)
2. **Recreate blueprint if needed:**
   - Add `render.yaml` back
   - Manual sync from GitHub
3. **Restore env vars** (from screenshots/backup)
4. **DNS unchanged** (api.cerply.com still points to same service)

**Risk Level:** üü¢ **LOW** - Deleting blueprint doesn't affect running services

---

## üí° Long-Term Recommendation

### Ideal Setup (After Cleanup)

**Services:**
```
cerply-api-prod
‚îú‚îÄ Branch: main
‚îú‚îÄ Deploy: Auto on push to main

cerply-api-staging  
‚îú‚îÄ Branch: staging
‚îú‚îÄ Deploy: Auto on push to staging
‚îú‚îÄ URL: cerply-api-staging.onrender.com
‚îî‚îÄ Env: CERTIFIED_ENABLED=true, RETENTION_ENABLED=true, ...
```

**Deployment Flow:**
```
1. Feature branch ‚Üí staging (PR) ‚Üí Deploy to cerply-api-staging
2. Test on staging
3. staging ‚Üí main (PR) ‚Üí Deploy to cerply-api-prod
4. Verify production
```

**Configuration:**
- Environment variables: Managed in Render dashboard
