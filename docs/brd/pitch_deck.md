## 1) The Problem — Expensive Training, Little Retention
- Enterprises spend hundreds of billions of dollars annually on training; yet most knowledge is not retained or applied.
- Critical institutional knowledge (compliance, safety, sales methodology, internal policies) is locked in dense, static documents and meetings.
- Current approaches fall short:
  - Traditional Learning Management Systems (LMS) track completion, not understanding.
  - Slides & videos are passive, hard to audit, and go stale quickly.
  - Generic AI chat can summarise but lacks pedagogy, governance, and auditibility for the enterprise.

Impact: Repeated errors, re‑learning, audit risk, and a widening gap between “what the org knows” and “what people remember and can use.”

---

## 2) Cerply — Turning Information into Provable Expertise
Cerply is a learning engine that becomes your company’s institutional memory.

- Ingest anything: regulations, policies, playbooks, meeting transcripts, steerco packs, customer notes.
- Generate adaptive micro‑lessons with multi‑model cross‑checks and quality gating.
- Deliver in a natural chat experience that feels intuitive and motivating.
- Refresh forever: spaced recall ensures knowledge is revisited over time—nothing is forgotten unless intentionally retired.
- Prove it: manager dashboards show comprehension and retention, not just completion.
- Certify it: expert panels validate market‑horizontal modules that any client can adopt and adapt to internal nuances; for high‑stakes topics this creates auditable trust.

---

## 3) What Makes Cerply Different (Moat)
Hybrid Intelligence Flywheel
- AI at scale (Engine): Multi‑model generation + cross‑checks; best variants are cached and reused (quality-first, cost-aware).
- Human trust (Certified Panels): Small panels of recognised experts review and approve mission‑critical content. Certified modules are market‑horizontal and reusable across clients, with optional adaptation for each organisation’s interpretations and nuances.
- Long‑term memory: The platform schedules recall for as long as topics remain live; performance signals continuously adapt the experience.

Result: A compounding catalogue of high‑quality, certified content; lower marginal cost over time; measurable business outcomes.

---

## 4) Certified Panels — Door‑Opener & Brand Builder
- We host high‑value, low‑commitment workshops and panels for target organisations (e.g., UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) changes, data residency, safety updates).
- Outcomes:
  - Organisations leave with a practical, draft learning track and a clear view of impact.
  - Panels can be standalone or bolted onto larger industry seminars.
  - Builds credibility and relationships while seeding Cerply Certified content used across clients.
- Certification is not limited to regulation. For example, a leading independent trader can certify a trading module; the common thread is that modules are attested by qualified, recognised names.

Consulting as go‑to‑market (GTM): These sessions both help the market and feed the certified catalogue, accelerating adoption.

## 5) Product Walk‑Through

### 5.1 Manager (Curator) Experience
- Create tracks: Pick a topic (e.g., “Architecture Standards 2025”), ingest source artefacts, and generate a curated learning track.
- Assign & subscribe: Enrol teams or groups (e.g., all Architects) and set policies (frequency, priority, due dates).
- Certify when needed: Route modules to expert panels to mark as Cerply Certified.
- See outcomes: Dashboards show comprehension, retention over time, and at‑risk areas across teams.

### 5.2 Learner Experience
- Chat‑first learning: Receive short, contextual prompts and micro‑lessons—bite‑size, adaptive, timely.
- Active recall: Learners answer; the system auto‑assesses correctness and timing; explanations appear when needed.
- Adaptive engine: Difficulty and item type adjust based on performance signals; variants surface to strengthen weak spots.
- Always-on memory: The system refreshes knowledge periodically—no silent forgetting while a track remains live.

### 5.3 Self‑Serve Ingestion (Employee Value)
- Individuals can load their own artefacts (notes, transcripts, project packs) to turn meetings and documents into retainable knowledge that also benefits the team.

---

## 6) How It Works (Architecture at a Glance)
- Ingestion & Canon Store: Normalise sources → generate high‑quality candidates → select & cache the best (“canon”) for reuse.
- Quality Floor: Heuristic and model‑assisted checks; low‑quality outputs are retried or rejected.
- Adaptive Engine: Observes correctness, latency and confusion → adjusts difficulty, schedule, and variants.
- Certified Workflow: Expert review, reviewer trails, signatures; auditable artefacts and versioning.
- Observability: Per‑request headers and metrics (quality score, reuse/fresh, adaptation signals).
- Enterprise Integration: Single Sign‑On (SSO), group sync, Role‑Based Access Control (RBAC); export Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) for Human Resources (HR) systems, Learning Management Systems (LMS), and Business Intelligence (BI) tools; encryption in transit and at rest; data residency options.
- Interface: Cerply desktop or web applications (Managers / Learners), or via enterprise chat channels - MS Teams, Slack, WhatsApp, etc. (Learners)

---

## 7) Security, Privacy & Governance
- Single Sign‑On (SSO) and Role‑Based Access Control (RBAC) with roles (admin, manager, learner).
- Encryption in transit and at rest; scoped retention for artefacts and telemetry.
- Auditability: Reviewer trails for Certified modules; immutable signatures.
- Data control: Topic retirement, data export and deletion tooling.
- Compliance roadmap: SOC 2 (Service Organization Control 2) and ISO/IEC 27001; customer data‑processing addendum.

## 8) Go‑To‑Market — Software‑First, Consulting‑Enabled
**We lead with software outcomes; consulting accelerates adoption.**
1) Attract (Thought Leadership): Invite‑only workshops/panels on high‑impact topics for target sectors.  
2) Engage (Design Sprint): Paid, fixed‑scope engagement to co‑create the first track; proves value quickly.  
3) Scale (Enterprise SaaS): Multi‑year subscription with optional Certified panels and consulting expansions.

Why this works: Enterprise sales are built on trust. We deliver outcomes first, then scale software usage across the organisation.

---

## 9) Who We Serve
- Regulated & safety‑critical (financial services, healthcare, energy, manufacturing).  
- Knowledge-intense teams (architecture, engineering, security, legal, data).  
- Small & medium enterprises benefit from ready‑to‑deploy certified tracks without needing large internal L&D teams.

---

## 10) Market & Timing
- Corporate training spend is widely reported in the hundreds of billions of dollars annually, with persistent concerns about knowledge decay and effectiveness.  
- Enterprises seek auditable, adaptive approaches that prove comprehension, not just completion.

(See references in Appendix; figures are indicative and will be tailored per audience.)

---

- M10+: Benchmarks across clients (privacy‑preserving); expanded expert marketplace.

---

## 14) Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) We Track
- Time‑to‑first track; % certified content in use.  
- Retention uplift over baseline; recall intervals achieved.  
- Manager dashboard utilisation; at‑risk topics reduced.  
- Canon reuse rate; cost per high‑quality item.

---

## 15) Competition & Why We Win
- Traditional platforms measure completion; we measure comprehension and retention over time.  
- Generic AI tools produce one‑off answers; we build persistent institutional memory with governance and certification.  
- Consulting-only offerings lack the always‑on engine and data feedback loop.

---

## 16) Summary
- Cerply creates a living, auditable institutional memory.  
- Managers curate topics once; the platform ensures teams learn and keep it.  
- Certified panels add trust; consulting-led GTM accelerates adoption.  
- Nothing is forgotten while topics are live—knowledge is refreshed in perpetuity.

Learn anything. Remember everything.
