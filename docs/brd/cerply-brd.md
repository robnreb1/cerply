# MVP Use Cases
> **Pivot note:** Cerply has pivoted from consumer to B2B SaaS focus. All use cases below are scoped for MVP and post-pivot strategy.
> **Update (2025-10-09):** Aligned MVP use cases with B2B pitch deck: WhatsApp delivery included in MVP; consumer payments and quotas removed; Certified positioned as horizontal with expert panels; manager-centric curation and analytics emphasised.

## All users
AU-1. Web app plus at least one channel integration for delivery (WhatsApp for MVP demo).
AU-2. Users can access core learning flows: ingest, plan, learn, quiz, review.
AU-3. Multi-device sync and offline support for lessons and quizzes.

## Learner
L-1. Learners can create and join projects with assigned topics.

L-6. Learners get spaced reviews based on forgetting curves.

L-9. Learners can participate in group challenges and competitions.
L-10. Learners can share feedback on content quality and difficulty.
