## Proposed Changes to `docs/brd/cerply-brd.md`

### 1. Update Pivot Note

**Current:**
```markdown
> **Update (2025-10-09):** Aligned MVP use cases with B2B pitch deck: WhatsApp delivery included in MVP; consumer payments and quotas removed; Certified positioned as horizontal with expert panels; manager-centric curation and analytics emphasised.
```

**Proposed:**
```markdown
> **Update (2025-10-10):** Aligned MVP with B2B strategy: Slack prioritized for channel delivery (WhatsApp Phase 2); ensemble content generation with 3-LLM pipeline for quality; gamification with levels/certificates/badges; conversational learning interface; true adaptive difficulty engine; consumer payments removed; Certified positioned as horizontal with expert panels; manager-centric curation and analytics emphasised.
```

---

### 2. Update AU-1 (All Users - Channel Integration)

**Current:**
```markdown
AU-1. Web app plus at least one channel integration for delivery (WhatsApp for MVP demo).
```

**Proposed:**
```markdown
AU-1. Web app plus at least one channel integration for delivery (Slack for MVP, WhatsApp Phase 2, Teams Phase 3).
```

**Rationale:** Epic 5 - Slack chosen over WhatsApp for faster B2B integration (6-8h vs 12-16h)

---

### 3. Update "Beyond MVP" Section (All Users)

**Current:**
```markdown
### Beyond MVP
- Extended channels — Slack, Microsoft Teams, Calendar, Telegram, and email digests (WhatsApp is part of MVP).
```

**Proposed:**
```markdown
### Beyond MVP
- Extended channels — WhatsApp (Phase 2), Microsoft Teams (Phase 3), Calendar, Telegram, and email digests.
- Multi-channel preferences: Primary + fallback channel configuration.
- Scheduled delivery: Daily/weekly cadence based on track subscription.
- Voice input for conversational interface.
```

---

### 4. Update L-2 (Learner - Adaptive Learning)

**Current:**
```markdown
L-2. Learners receive adaptive lesson plans based on progress and preferences.
```

**Proposed:**
```markdown
L-2. Learners receive truly adaptive lesson plans with dynamic difficulty adjustment (4 levels: Recall, Application, Analysis, Synthesis) based on real-time performance signals (correctness, response latency, confusion queries, spaced recall). System detects learning style (visual/verbal/kinesthetic) and adjusts content format accordingly. Weak topics (comprehension < 70%) automatically receive reinforcement.
```

**Rationale:** Epic 9 - True Adaptive Difficulty Engine (was vague "adaptive lesson plans", now specific)

---

### 5. Update L-12 (Learner - Natural Language Responses)

**Current:**
```markdown
L-12. Learner is always provided with an explainer—more detail if they got it wrong—or can query the answer or say they don't understand; the system responds in natural language.
```

**Proposed:**
```markdown
L-12. Learner interacts via conversational interface (chat panel, Cmd+K shortcut) with natural language queries: "How am I doing?", "What's next?", "I don't understand this answer". System uses intent router to classify queries (progress/next/explanation/filter/help) and responds intelligently. Free-text answers encouraged over multiple choice wherever possible, with NLP validation and partial credit ("Close, but X is more accurate because..."). Confusion queries tracked to adjust adaptive difficulty.
```

**Rationale:** Epic 8 - Conversational Learning Interface (was brief mention, now comprehensive)

---

### 6. Update L-16 (Learner - Certification Tracking)

**Current:**
```markdown
L-16. Learners can track progress against certification requirements.
```

**Proposed:**
```markdown
L-16. Learners progress through 5 levels per track (Novice → Learner → Practitioner → Expert → Master) based on correct attempts. Upon track completion, learners automatically receive downloadable PDF certificate with Ed25519 signature for verification. Learners unlock badges for achievements (Speed Demon, Perfectionist, 7-day Consistent, Knowledge Sharer, Lifelong Learner). Level-ups and certificate earnings trigger celebration UI and manager email notifications. Learners can query progress conversationally ("How am I doing?", "When will I complete this track?").
```

**Rationale:** Epic 7 - Gamification & Certification System (was vague "track progress", now detailed)

---

### 7. Add New L-17 (Learner - Channel Preferences)

**Proposed Addition (after L-16):**
```markdown
L-17. Learners can configure preferred delivery channel (Slack, web, email fallback) and set quiet hours to avoid notifications during specific times (e.g., "22:00-07:00"). Learners can pause and resume notifications as needed. Channel preferences stored per user with verification status.
```

**Rationale:** Epic 5 - Slack Channel Integration (missing from BRD)

---

### 8. Add New L-18 (Learner - Free-Text Input)

**Proposed Addition (after L-17):**
```markdown
L-18. Learners can answer questions using free-text input instead of multiple choice. System validates answers using NLP and LLM, accepts partial credit, and provides constructive feedback. Multiple choice reserved only for yes/no or categorical questions where free-text doesn't make sense.
```

**Rationale:** Epic 8 - Conversational Interface (avoid MCQ where possible)

---

### 9. Update B-3 (Business - Content Customization)

**Current:**
```markdown
B-3. Businesses can customize content for internal policies.
```

**Proposed:**
```markdown
B-3. Businesses can customize content for internal policies. Managers upload artefacts (documents, transcripts, policies) and receive LLM playback of understanding ("I understand this covers X, Y, Z"). Manager confirms or refines iteratively (max 3 rounds) until approved. System then triggers 3-LLM ensemble generation: Generator A and Generator B independently create content, then Fact-Checker LLM verifies accuracy, removes fluff, and selects best elements from both. Manager reviews generated content with provenance transparency (which LLM contributed each section) and can regenerate specific modules. Content tagged as generic (industry-standard, reusable across orgs) or proprietary (company-specific, never shared). Generic content stored in canon for cost-efficient reuse.
```

**Rationale:** Epic 6 - Ensemble Content Generation (completely missing from BRD)

---

### 10. Update B-7 (Business - Channel Delivery)

**Current:**
```markdown
B-7. They can establish channels by which Learners are reminded—WhatsApp for MVP—with Slack and Microsoft Teams planned next.
```

**Proposed:**
```markdown
B-7. They can establish channels by which Learners are reminded—Slack for MVP (OAuth 2.0 integration with interactive Block Kit buttons for immediate response feedback)—with WhatsApp (Phase 2) and Microsoft Teams (Phase 3) planned next. Organization admins configure workspace-level channel integrations. Learners set individual channel preferences including quiet hours and pause/resume. Email fallback automatically activates if channel delivery fails.
```

**Rationale:** Epic 5 - Slack Channel Integration (WhatsApp → Slack priority change)

---

### 11. Add New B-15 (Business - Manager Notifications)

**Proposed Addition (after B-14):**
```markdown
B-15. Managers receive real-time email notifications when team members achieve milestones: level-up (e.g., Practitioner → Expert), earn certificates (track completion), or unlock badges. Notification preferences configurable (immediate, daily digest, weekly summary, or off). Daily digest example: "3 team members leveled up this week, 2 earned certificates". Managers can view notification center in dashboard with unread count and mark-as-read functionality.
```

**Rationale:** Epic 7 - Gamification (manager notifications missing from BRD)

---

### 12. Add New E-14 (Expert - Content Provenance)

**Proposed Addition (after E-13):**
```markdown
E-14. Experts can review content generation provenance when certifying modules. System displays which LLMs contributed to content (Generator A, Generator B, Fact-Checker), confidence scores, and manager refinement history. Expert reviews for factual accuracy, pedagogical soundness, and brand alignment. Upon approval, expert's Ed25519 signature permanently attached to content with immutable audit trail (reviewer identity, timestamp, rationale, citations).
```

**Rationale:** Epic 6 - Ensemble Content Generation + Epic 10 - Enhanced Certification (expert workflow missing)

---

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Customers expect WhatsApp in early demos | Lead with "Slack day-1, WhatsApp Q2 2025" messaging |
| 3-LLM pipeline adds cost | Generic content reuse reduces cost per org over time |
| Gamification may feel juvenile to some | Professional design, audit-ready certificates, manager notifications |
| Free-text grading complexity | Fall back to MCQ for ambiguous questions |
| Adaptive algorithm needs tuning | Start with proven SM2-lite, iterate based on data |

## Implementation Impact on BRD Metrics

### Existing Metrics (Still Valid):
- ✅ Team completion rates (Epic 4 - Manager Dashboard)
- ✅ Comprehension scores (Epic 4 - Analytics)
- ✅ At-risk learner identification (Epic 4 - Analytics)

### New Metrics to Track:
- **Epic 5:** Channel engagement rate (Slack vs web)
- **Epic 6:** Content generation cost per track (with canon reuse)
- **Epic 7:** Certificate issuance rate, badge unlock frequency
- **Epic 8:** Chat query volume, free-text vs MCQ ratio
- **Epic 9:** Difficulty distribution per learner, weak topic detection accuracy

## Appendix: Side-by-Side Comparison

### Before (Current BRD):
- ❌ Mentions "adaptive" but vague on how
- ❌ No mention of 3-LLM pipeline
- ❌ No mention of levels/badges/certificates
- ❌ No mention of conversational interface
- ❌ No mention of free-text answers
- ❌ WhatsApp listed as MVP channel
- ❌ No manager notification requirements

### After (Proposed BRD):
- ✅ Specific adaptive algorithm (4 difficulty levels, learning styles)
- ✅ Detailed 3-LLM ensemble pipeline
- ✅ Complete gamification system (5 levels, 5 badges, certificates)
- ✅ Conversational interface with intent router
- ✅ Free-text input with NLP validation
- ✅ Slack as MVP channel (WhatsApp Phase 2)
- ✅ Manager notification requirements specified

---

**Bottom Line:** BRD currently missing 80% of new features. This proposal brings it into full alignment with Epics 5-9.
