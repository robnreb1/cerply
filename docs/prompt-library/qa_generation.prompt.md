## Example

For a lesson on photosynthesis:
- Remember: "What are the three main ingredients needed for photosynthesis?"
- Understand: "Explain why plants need sunlight for photosynthesis"
- Apply: "How would you design an experiment to test photosynthesis rates?"
- Analyze: "Compare and contrast photosynthesis in different plant types"
- Evaluate: "Assess the impact of pollution on photosynthesis efficiency"
- Create: "Design a new plant species optimized for low-light environments"
