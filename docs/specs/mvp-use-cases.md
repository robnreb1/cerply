***This document is the single source of truth for MVP use cases.***

## All users
AU-1. Web only
AU-2. Landing page is impactful and clear about what we offer
AU-3. Encourages interaction through chat, rather than menus (though they can be accessed via footer links)
AU-4. Quickly directs user-groups to their appropriate workflows

**Beyond MVP:**
- Extended channels - Teams, Slack, WhatsApp, Calendar, Telegram, etc.

## Learner
L-1. Learners can prompt, load, link or click for a topic.
L-2. Learner is presented with a summary of the topic, to confirm it is in-line with their intent.
L-3. Learner must be logged-in to progress, otherwise Cerply can't adapt or ensure they remember over the long term.
L-4. Learner is offered one free Cerply Certified topic per month
L-5. Learner provides some basic preference details as part of sign-up; learning style, topics of interest, time available, notification types, etc.
L-6. Once signed-up the Learner is presented with their first interactions on the topic they signed-up for.
L-7. They are pushed to complete ten questions each time, but progress is always tracked so fine if they finish early
L-8. Learner can continue for longer if they choose to
L-9. If the Learner has multiple live topics against their profile they are always shown their level for the topic at hand e.g. beginner, novice, intermediate, advanced, expert, world-class
L-10. Learners can view their topics and levels at any point; they can turn them on/off as required
L-11. Sessions and topics will adapt to the user's level and learning patterns, more time spent on weaker subjects, but always maintaining content for even long-running, elite level topics
L-12. Learner is always provided with an explainer, more detail if they got it wrong, query the answer, or state that they don't understand
L-13. Learner can interact with Cerply using natural language at all times, even though some questions may be multiple-choice, or more fixed by nature.
L-14. If a time-limit has been set to reach a certain level of a topic - e.g. 1 month for corporate compliance training, or 6 weeks to prepare for an exam - extra weighting will be given to the topic, appropriate to the knowledge gap in relation to time remaining.
L-15. Learner never experiences exactly the same content twice - nothing is fully templated.
L-16. Learner can set their own time-limits on topics. If the Learner has been assigned a topic by a manager, they can not adjust the associated timer.
L-17. Learner can pay for premium features through subscription (£10pm) or one-off access to specific topics (£5 per topic).
L-18. The fee includes all subsequent updates to topics registered for; the topic is kept fresh for life, even if the subscription is halted.
L-19. Learner is limited to 5 certified topics per month on the subscription.
L-20. Learner is limited to 1 certified topic per month on the free plan.
L-21. Learner is limited to 5 non-certified topics per month on the free plan.
L-22. Learner can pay in any currency they wish, inc. crypto, though must cover the exchange fees to GBP (this is not publicised).
L-23. Cerply must ensure Learner is wowed by the offering in order to drive them to, and maintain them in, the premium tier.
L-24. Learner is never left hanging, when content is being created (which can take time as there can be deep research and multi-model interactions in the workflow), they are still kept active e.g. more profile questions, live topics, progress stats, other topics they may be interested in, etc. - These shouldn't be templated but they should be pre-prompted for the scenario.

**Beyond MVP:**

- Video interaction

## Expert
E-1. Understands that they will get paid to refine and certify content, dependent on their credentials.
E-2. Must complete a profile that details their areas of expertise, authority, network, etc.
E-3. Understand that their name and role will be cited for certified topics
E-4. Cerply performs due diligence and informs them of the decision and the rate for refining and certifying topics.
E-5. If they were provided with a rate in advance (by a Cerply representative) they can enter their code and it will be pre-applied to specific topics.
E-6. They will be provided with a list of topics that require certification.
E-7. In most instances Cerply will work with a panel of experts to certify a topic, the average will be used and total fund split across those that contributed most accurately.
E-8. Experts that are used for a topic will also remain on hand to resolve queries when they arrive, that can't be handled by Cerply; each time for an appropriate fee that results in refreshed content.
E-9. Some topics will need to be refreshed incrementally to stay current, Experts will be synchronised accordingly.
E-10. Expert can access their profile at any point to change their details and view statistics regarding Learner satisfaction with their content, challenges, income generated, etc.
E-11. Expert can be paid in any currency, inc. crypto, with no expiration date to withdraw, and with Cerply making no margin/fee on exchange costs.

**Beyond MVP:**
- Regulator certified
- Exam board certified
- Shared revenue option
- Network marketing

## Business
B-1. Assumes a business owner, COO, L&D manager, team manager, training partner, consultancy.
B-2. Provided with the ability to build a team within the portal
B-3. Builds topics in similar ways to a Learner, but then validates like an Expert
B-4. Envisage a Cursor type interface with the content in the main window but then filters and inputs in satellite windows that refine the content. e.g. Introduce company specific terms, documents, standards, policies, rules, processes, people, etc. So they can take Cerply generated or Certified content, and then adapt it to their own needs.
B-5. They can also put guardrails around the adaptive learning to ensure it stays within company boundaries.
B-6. They can push topics to their teams, all or partial coverage, including timeframe and required level to complete.
B-7. They can establish channels by which Learners can be reminded - probably just Email or Teams for the MVP.
B-8. They can review statistics for their team; progress, overdue, engagement, areas of challenge, topics beyond those pushed (subject to privacy policies)
B-9. £100 per user per year will be the standard rate, providing access to the full library of Certified content.
B-10. Access lost when subscription ends.
B-11. Provided with a guarantee that any market changes to certified content will be incorporated within 2 weeks of release (or discounts applied).
B-12. Can request new certified topics to be accelerated, for a fee.

**Beyond MVP:**
- Desktop app is key
- Regulatory compliance
- Wide portfolio of Certified content
- Automatic notifications / PR for Learners hitting milestones

## Admin / Cerply
A-1. Full write access to all areas
A-2. View of all logs of all changes made (immutable)
A-3. Can manually add users to any group
A-4. Stats screens that show how every component of Cerply is performing
A-5. Ability to analyse granular detail regarding learning habits - every bit of data is saved (and well modelled so easy to navigate)
A-6. Ability to tweak the prompts as needed across the different interactions and models
A-7. Certified topics should be size-bound (though can exist as part of a much broader parent subject) to balance build effort with client cost.
A-8. If a topic is net-new it is assessed by the multi-model workflow. Internally this achieves an 'interim-certified' status. This content is then reused for future requests of the same topic.
A-9. We should suggest a blend of Certified (paid) and interim-certified topics to Learners.

**Beyond MVP:**
- Integrate sponsored topics rather than advertising e.g. brand xyz could bring awareness to their industry, product, and brand, through a 'Certified' topic that is then proposed as a freebie to Learners.
