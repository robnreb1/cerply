---

## Changes Implemented

### 1. ✅ Removed D2C Chat Interface
**Files Modified:**
- `web/app/page.tsx` - Replaced consumer chat with redirect to `/login`

**Before:** Chat-first interface for individual consumers  
**After:** Immediate redirect to enterprise login page

### 2. ✅ Updated Login to Enterprise-Focused
**Files Modified:**
- `web/app/login/page.tsx` - Enterprise-focused copy and UI

**Changes:**
- Title: "Log in to Cerply" → "Enterprise Login"
- Placeholder: "you@example.com" → "your.name@organization.com"
- Button: "Send magic link" → "Continue with Enterprise Login"
- Description: Now mentions "organization email" and "administrator"

### 3. ✅ Created Unauthorized Page
**Files Created:**
- `web/app/unauthorized/page.tsx` - Access restricted page for non-enterprise users

**Features:**
- Clear messaging about enterprise-only access
- "Contact Support" button (mailto)
- "Try logging in again" link
- Professional, empathetic design

### 4. ✅ Expanded Middleware for Auth Enforcement
**Files Modified:**
- `web/middleware.ts` - Enhanced auth gating

**Changes:**
- Updated allowlist: `/login`, `/unauthorized`, `/api/health`, `/api/auth`, `/debug/env`
- All other routes redirect to `/login` if no auth
- Preserves beta invite code logic for development
- Redirects include `from` parameter for post-login routing

### 5. ✅ Updated Marketing Site with B2B Copy
**Files Modified:**
- `web-marketing/components/Hero.tsx`
- `web-marketing/components/WaitlistModal.tsx`

- "Join the waitlist" → "Request a Demo"
- Updated descriptions to focus on teams, organizations, enterprise outcomes
- Replaced "you" with "your team/organization" throughout

### 6. ✅ Added E2E Tests
**Files Created:**
- `web/e2e/enterprise-auth.spec.ts` - Comprehensive auth gating tests

**Test Coverage:**
- Anonymous user redirect to login
- Unauthorized page display
- Login page accessibility
- Protected route gating
- Health endpoint accessibility
- Enterprise copy verification
- Support link functionality

## Acceptance Tests

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Test 1: Home redirects to login
curl -I http://localhost:3000/
# Expected: 307 redirect to /login

# Test 2: Login is accessible
curl -sS http://localhost:3000/login | grep "Enterprise Login"
# Expected: "Enterprise Login" found

# Test 3: Unauthorized page accessible
curl -sS http://localhost:3000/unauthorized | grep "Access Restricted"
# Expected: "Access Restricted" found

# Test 4: Protected routes redirect
curl -I http://localhost:3000/curate
# Expected: 307 redirect to /login?from=/curate

# Test 5: Health endpoint accessible
curl -sS http://localhost:3000/api/health | jq .ok
# Expected: true

# Test 6: Marketing site B2B copy
curl -sS http://localhost:3002/ | grep "Your Team"
# Expected: "Your Team" found
```

### E2E Test Results

```bash
cd web
npm run test:e2e:enterprise

# Expected output:
# ✓ redirects anonymous user from home to login
# ✓ shows unauthorized page for non-enterprise users
# ✓ allows access to login page without auth
# ✓ redirects from protected routes to login
# ✓ allows access to API health without auth
# ✓ displays enterprise-focused copy
# ✓ login page has enterprise-focused UI
# ✓ unauthorized page has support links
```

## Migration Notes

### For Existing Users
- No data migration required
- Existing sessions remain valid
- Beta invite codes still work for development

### For New Deployments
**Environment Variables:**
```bash
# App (web/)
APP_ALLOWLIST_ROUTES="/login,/unauthorized,/api/health,/api/auth,/debug/env"
BETA_INVITE_CODES="demo123,friend456"  # Dev/staging only

# Marketing (web-marketing/)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL="https://www.cerply.com"
```

---

## Known Limitations

1. **SSO Not Yet Implemented:** Login still uses magic links (EPIC 2)
2. **RBAC Not Yet Implemented:** No role-based permissions yet (EPIC 2)
3. **Team Management Not Yet Implemented:** No team/org structure (EPIC 3)
4. **Placeholder Copy:** Marketing site copy is basic (user will refine)

---

## Next Steps

### EPIC 2: Enterprise SSO & RBAC
- Implement SAML/OIDC providers
- Add role-based access control
- Create organization model
- Admin user management

**Estimated:** 1 overnight (8-10 hours)

- ✅ Updated login to enterprise-focused UI
- ✅ Created `/unauthorized` page for non-enterprise users
- ✅ Expanded middleware to enforce auth on all routes
- ✅ Updated marketing site with B2B placeholder copy
- ✅ Added comprehensive E2E tests

## Testing
```bash
# Run E2E tests
cd web && npm run test:e2e:enterprise

# Manual smoke tests
curl -I http://localhost:3000/ | grep "307"  # Redirects
curl -sS http://localhost:3000/login | grep "Enterprise"  # Enterprise UI
curl -sS http://localhost:3000/api/health  # Still accessible
```

## Breaking Changes
- Home `/` now redirects to `/login` instead of showing chat
- All routes except allowlist now require authentication
- Marketing copy changed to B2B focus

## Next Epic
