# Quality-First Content Pipeline

This document describes the content generation pipeline that ensures high-quality, reusable learning content through ensemble methods, canonization, and intelligent caching.

## Overview

The quality-first pipeline ensures that:
1. First-time content generation uses top models with cross-validation
2. Generated content is canonized with metadata and lineage
3. Subsequent requests reuse canonical content for efficiency
4. Certified content adds human-in-the-loop validation
5. All content maintains quality standards regardless of source

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Content Request Analysis

**Input:** User topic, context, preferences, time constraints
**Process:**
- Analyze topic complexity and scope
- Check canon store for existing high-quality content
- Determine if ensemble generation is required
- Route to appropriate generation path

**Output:** Generation strategy and resource allocation

### 2. Ensemble Generation (First-Time)

**Models Used:**
- **Primary:** GPT-5 for main content generation
- **Cross-Reference:** Secondary model for validation and refinement
- **Quality Check:** Third model for coherence and accuracy validation

**Process:**
- Generate initial content with primary model
- Cross-validate with secondary model
- Refine based on discrepancies
- Final quality check for coherence and accuracy
- Generate multiple variants for different learner levels

**Quality Gates:**
- Coherence score ≥ 0.8
- Coverage completeness ≥ 0.85
- Factual accuracy validation
- Pedagogical soundness check

### 3. Canonization

**Metadata Schema:**
```typescript
interface CanonicalContent {
  id: string;
  sha: string;
  content: ContentBody;
  lineage: {
    sourceModels: string[];
    generationTimestamp: string;
    qualityScores: QualityMetrics;
    validationResults: ValidationResult[];
  };
  metadata: {
    topic: string;
    difficulty: 'beginner' | 'intermediate' | 'advanced';
    estimatedTime: number;
    prerequisites: string[];
    learningObjectives: string[];
  };
  tags: string[];
  citations: Citation[];
  version: string;
  status: 'draft' | 'validated' | 'certified';
}
```

**Storage:**
- Content stored with SHA for integrity
- Metadata enables semantic search
- Lineage tracks generation process
- Versioning supports iterative improvement

### 4. Certified Path (HITL)

**Human-in-the-Loop Process:**
- Expert review of generated content
- Pedagogical validation by education specialists
- Fact-checking by domain experts
- Accessibility review for inclusive design
- Final approval and certification

**Certification Metadata:**
```typescript
interface CertifiedContent extends CanonicalContent {
  certification: {
    expertId: string;
    expertCredentials: string[];
    reviewTimestamp: string;
    approvalStatus: 'approved' | 'needs_revision' | 'rejected';
    revisionNotes?: string;
    auditTrail: AuditEntry[];
  };
  qualityAssurance: {
    factCheckResults: FactCheckResult[];
    accessibilityCompliance: AccessibilityReport;
    pedagogicalReview: PedagogicalReview;
  };
}
```

### 5. Reuse and Retrieval

**Retrieval Methods:**
- **Semantic Search:** Find content by meaning and context
- **Hash Lookup:** Exact match for identical requests
- **Metadata Filtering:** Match by difficulty, topic, time constraints
- **Lineage Tracking:** Understand content provenance

**Reuse Strategy:**
- Exact matches: Return canonical content immediately
- Semantic matches: Adapt canonical content to new context
- Partial matches: Extract relevant sections and supplement
- No matches: Trigger ensemble generation for new content

## Quality Metrics

### Coherence Score (0-1)
- Content flows logically from concept to concept
- Examples support learning objectives
- Language is consistent and appropriate
- Structure follows pedagogical best practices

### Coverage Completeness (0-1)
- All key concepts for topic are included
- Learning objectives are fully addressed
- Prerequisites are identified and covered
- Advanced concepts are appropriately introduced

### Factual Accuracy
- Information is current and correct
- Sources are reliable and cited
- Claims are supported by evidence
- No contradictions within content

### Pedagogical Soundness
- Content follows learning science principles
- Difficulty progression is appropriate
- Examples are relevant and helpful
- Assessment questions test understanding

## Implementation

### API Endpoints

```typescript
// Generate new content with ensemble
POST /api/content/generate
{
  topic: string;
  context: LearnerContext;
  qualityLevel: 'standard' | 'certified';
  timeConstraint?: number;
}

// Retrieve from canon store
GET /api/content/canon/:sha
GET /api/content/search?topic=...&difficulty=...&time=...

// Submit for certification
POST /api/content/certify/:contentId
{
  expertId: string;
  reviewNotes: string;
  approvalStatus: 'approved' | 'needs_revision';
}
```

### Caching Strategy

**Cache Layers:**
1. **Memory Cache:** Frequently accessed canonical content
2. **Semantic Cache:** Content by topic and context similarity
3. **Hash Cache:** Exact content matches
4. **Metadata Cache:** Search indices and filtering

**Cache Invalidation:**
- Content updates trigger cache refresh
- Quality score changes update metadata
- Certification status changes update all layers
- Time-based expiration for non-certified content

## Quality Assurance

### Automated Checks
- Grammar and spelling validation
- Factual consistency checks
- Citation verification
- Accessibility compliance
- Learning objective alignment

### Human Review
- Expert domain validation
- Pedagogical soundness review
- Cultural sensitivity check
