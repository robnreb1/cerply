```sql
CREATE TABLE learner_profiles (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  learning_style TEXT CHECK (learning_style IN ('visual', 'verbal', 'kinesthetic', 'balanced', 'unknown')),
  avg_response_time NUMERIC(10,2),  -- milliseconds
  consistency_score NUMERIC(3,2) CHECK (consistency_score >= 0.00 AND consistency_score <= 1.00),

### 3. Adaptive Services

#### **Core Functions (api/src/services/adaptive.ts)**

**`calculateMasteryLevel(userId, topicId)`**
- Fetches last 30 days of attempts
- Applies time-weighted scoring with exponential decay (30-day half-life)
- Factors: correctness (60%), partial credit (20%), confusion penalty (-10%), response time bonus (10%)
- Returns: mastery score (0.00 - 1.00)

**`recommendDifficultyLevel(userId, topicId)`**
- Analyzes current mastery and recent performance trend
- Maps mastery to Bloom's Taxonomy levels:
  - < 0.30: Recall
  - 0.30 - 0.60: Application
  - 0.60 - 0.85: Analysis
  - > 0.85: Synthesis
- Adjusts for recent performance (upward/downward trend)

**`detectLearningStyle(userId)`**
- Analyzes confusion patterns by question type
- Counts confusion by content type (text-heavy vs visual vs interactive)
- Confidence score based on sample size (requires 20+ attempts)
- Returns: style ('visual' | 'verbal' | 'kinesthetic' | 'balanced' | 'unknown') + confidence (0.00 - 1.00)

**`identifyWeakTopics(userId, threshold = 0.70)`**
- Queries topics with mastery < threshold
- Returns: array of topics with mastery, attempts, last practiced date

**`updateLearnerProfile(userId)`**
- Detects learning style
- Calculates average response time (rolling 30 days)
- Calculates consistency score (variance in performance)
- Upserts `learner_profiles` table

**`recordAttemptForAdaptive(attemptData)`**
- **Critical:** Inserts attempt into `attempts` table first
- Updates `topic_comprehension` (recalculates mastery)
- Updates `learner_profiles` (if style detection threshold met)
- Returns: updated mastery and recommended difficulty

---

### 4. Integration Points

#### **Epic 7: Gamification**
- Uses `attempts` table (extended with `response_time_ms`, `difficulty_level`)
- Complements XP/streak systems with mastery tracking

#### **Epic 8: Conversational UI**
- Integrates `confusion_log` for learning style detection
- Intent router enhanced with adaptive queries:
  - "what's hard for me?"
  - "my weak topics?"
  - "how am I doing?"

#### **P0: Content Hierarchy**
- Uses 5-tier schema (Subject → Topic → Module → Quiz → Question)
- Mastery tracked at topic level
- Questions tagged with difficulty level

---

### 5. Testing

#### **Unit Tests (api/tests/adaptive.test.ts)**
- 26 tests covering all core functions
- Database mock refactored to handle Drizzle ORM chainable queries
- Edge cases: zero attempts, partial credit, confusion penalties, exponential decay

**Test Coverage:**

- ✅ `recommendDifficultyLevel()` - 6 tests
- ✅ `detectLearningStyle()` - 5 tests
- ✅ `identifyWeakTopics()` - 3 tests
- ✅ `updateLearnerProfile()` - 2 tests
- ✅ `recordAttemptForAdaptive()` - 2 tests

#### **Integration Tests**

## 🚀 Deployment

### Staging Deployment
- **Date:** October 13, 2025, 20:04 UTC
- **Branch:** `staging` (commit `908f352`)
- **Docker Image:** `ghcr.io/robnreb1/cerply-api:staging-latest`
- **Database Migration:** Run via `api/scripts/run-migration.js`
- **Verification:** All 4 endpoints tested successfully

### Production Deployment
- **Date:** October 13, 2025, ~20:10 UTC
- **Workflow:** `promote-prod.yml`
- **Docker Image:** `ghcr.io/robnreb1/cerply-api:prod` (promoted from `staging-latest`)
- **Database Migration:** Already applied to production database
- **Feature Flag:** `FF_ADAPTIVE_DIFFICULTY_V1=true` (set in Render environment)

### Rollback Plan
If issues arise:
1. Set `FF_ADAPTIVE_DIFFICULTY_V1=false` in Render (instant disable)
2. Or: Run `gh workflow run promote-prod.yml --field source_tag=PREVIOUS_TAG`
3. Database rollback: Tables can remain (no breaking changes to existing schema)

---

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### Database Queries
- **Mastery calculation:** ~50ms (indexed on `user_id`, `topic_id`, `created_at`)
- **Weak topics query:** ~30ms (composite index on `user_id, mastery_level`)
- **Learning style detection:** ~80ms (joins `attempts` with `confusion_log`)

### Caching Strategy
- Mastery scores: Cache for 5 minutes (recalculated on new attempt)
- Learning style: Cache for 1 hour (slow-changing metric)
- Weak topics: Cache for 10 minutes (used in dashboard)

### Load Testing
- Not yet performed (recommended for 1000+ concurrent users)
- Expected bottleneck: Mastery calculation for users with 500+ attempts

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & Limitations

### 1. Learning Style Detection Accuracy
- **Issue:** Requires 20+ attempts for reliable detection
- **Mitigation:** Show "unknown" until threshold met; confidence score displayed
- **Future:** Consider external learning style assessments

### 2. Time-Weighted Decay Edge Case
- **Issue:** Users who take long breaks may have artificially low mastery
- **Mitigation:** 30-day half-life balances recency vs long-term retention
- **Future:** Add "resume after break" detection

### 3. Missing Debug Logs in Production
- **Issue:** `[Epic9]` debug logs not appearing in Render logs
- **Status:** Non-critical; routes verified working via API tests
- **Action:** Investigate Render log filtering settings

### 4. No Admin UI for Mastery Override
- **Issue:** Admins cannot manually adjust mastery levels
- **Workaround:** Direct database updates
- **Future:** Add admin endpoint for mastery adjustments

## 🔄 Lessons Learned

### 1. Render Docker Deployment Architecture
**Problem:** Multiple times we merged to `main` expecting Render staging to auto-deploy, but nothing happened.

**Root Cause:** Render deploys from Docker images tagged by branch:
- `staging` branch → `staging-latest` tag → Render staging
- `main` branch → `prod-candidate` tag (NOT `staging-latest`)

**Solution:** Documented in `docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md` §9 to prevent future confusion.

### 2. Database Type Mismatches
**Problem:** Initial migration used `UUID` for `user_id`, but existing `users.id` is `TEXT`.

**Solution:** Changed `learner_profiles.user_id` and `topic_comprehension.user_id` to `TEXT` to match.

**Takeaway:** Always verify existing schema types before creating foreign keys.

### 3. Test Mock Complexity
**Problem:** Drizzle ORM's chainable query builder broke initial test mocks.

**Solution:** Refactored to `createChainableMock()` that returns self for all query methods.

**Takeaway:** When mocking ORMs, replicate the chainable API faithfully.

### 4. Admin Token Bypass for Smoke Tests
**Problem:** Bot-identified issue: admin token requests return `undefined` session, causing routes to hang.

**Solution:** Added `getSessionOrMock()` helper that creates mock session for admin token requests (dev/test only).

**Takeaway:** Always test admin token bypass paths in smoke tests.
