# Cerply: Market Readiness - One Pager
**For Business Partner Review | October 14, 2025**

---

## 🎯 **The Product**

**Intelligent B2B learning platform** that generates personalized, adaptive training on-demand.

**Killer Features:**
- Conversational interface (natural language, like ChatGPT)
- Smart intent detection (understands subject/topic/skill automatically)
- Real-time adaptation (content adjusts to performance)
- Multi-LLM generation (3 models, high quality, cited sources)

---

## ✅ **What's Working (90% Complete)**

| Feature | Status | Value |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Conversational UX | ✅ Live | Users describe needs naturally |
| Granularity detection | ✅ Live | System routes intelligently (our moat) |
| Adaptive engine | ✅ Live | Content difficulty adjusts automatically |
| Topic clarification | ✅ Live | Confirms user intent before generating |
| B2B infrastructure | ✅ Live | SSO, teams, analytics, dashboards |

**Demo-able today:** User → describes goal → Cerply clarifies → user confirms  
**Gap:** Content generation after confirmation (API exists, needs UI hookup)

---

## ⚠️ **What's Blocking Launch (10% Remaining)**

### **Critical Path:**
1. **Content generation hookup** (4-6 hours)
   - Connect confirmation → generation API call
   - Display curriculum (modules/quizzes)
   - **Impact:** Complete learner journey (describe → confirm → learn)

2. **Seed 20 topics** (12-16 hours)
   - High-value business skills (leadership, sales, management)
   - Quality-check each one
   - **Impact:** Demo library for pilots

**Total Time:** 1 focused week → launch-ready

---

## 💪 **Competitive Advantages (Why We Win)**

1. **Data moat** - Every interaction builds learning graph (compounds over time)
2. **Product moat** - Smart routing vs. rigid course catalogs (feels like magic)
3. **Quality moat** - 3-LLM consensus (prevents hallucinations)
4. **Tech moat** - Adaptive from day one (not bolted-on)

---

## 💰 **Business Model**

**Target Pricing:**
- Free: 3 topics/user/month
- Team: $15/user/month (unlimited topics, analytics)
- Enterprise: $50/user/month (certified content, SSO)

**Unit Economics:**
- Content cost: $0.25/topic (within budget)
- Projected LTV:CAC = 4.5:1 (healthy)

---

## 🚀 **Launch Plan (Next 7 Days)**

**Day 1-2:** Complete content generation hookup + testing  
**Day 3-5:** Seed 20 high-quality topics  
**Day 6:** Record demo video + beta signup page  
**Day 7:** Launch beta, start pilot outreach  

**Outcome:** Demo-ready product, pilots starting week 2

---

## 🎯 **Success Metrics (First 90 Days)**

- 500+ users onboarded
- 10+ paid teams
- 2+ enterprise pilots
- >80% topic completion rate
- NPS >40

---

## ❓ **Decision Points for This Meeting**

1. **Timeline:** Commit to 1-week sprint to launch-ready?
2. **Launch strategy:** Beta signups vs. direct pilots?
3. **Topic library:** Launch with 20 topics or wait for 100?
4. **Pricing:** Validate $15 Team / $50 Enterprise tiers?
5. **First customers:** Who are our first 5 pilot targets?

---

## 🏁 **Bottom Line**

**We're 90% done.** One week of focused work → launch-ready product.

**Our moats are strong** (data, intelligence, adaptivity, quality).

**Time to ship** and get market feedback. 🚀
