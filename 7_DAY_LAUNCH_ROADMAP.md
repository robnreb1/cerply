---

## 🎯 **DAY 7: Launch Beta**

### **Goal:** Start collecting real user feedback

**Morning:**
- [ ] Go/no-go decision (final quality check)
- [ ] Announce beta launch internally
- [ ] Share beta signup link on LinkedIn, Twitter, email list

**Afternoon:**
- [ ] Send pilot outreach emails (5 targets)
- [ ] Monitor beta signups
- [ ] Respond to early questions/feedback

**Evening:**
- [ ] Review first-day metrics:
  - Beta signups
  - Demo video views
  - Pilot responses
  - Any technical issues

**Deliverable:** Beta live, signups coming in, pilots in motion

**Effort:** 4 hours (coordination + monitoring)  
**Owner:** Full team  
**Success Metric:** 20+ beta signups, 2+ pilot responses

---

## 📊 **Daily Standup Format**

### **Questions:**
1. What shipped yesterday?
2. What's shipping today?
3. Any blockers?
4. Launch confidence (1-10)?

### **Key Metrics to Track:**
- Features completed vs. planned
- Topics generated vs. target (20)
- Quality scores (target: >0.85)
- Cost per topic (target: <$0.30)
- Launch confidence score

---

## 🚨 **Risk Mitigation**

### **Risk 1: Content generation takes longer than expected**
- **Mitigation:** Start with 10 topics (not 20) for MVP
- **Decision point:** Day 3 (if behind, reduce scope)

### **Risk 2: Quality scores below target**
- **Mitigation:** Regenerate with adjusted prompts
- **Decision point:** Day 4 (if <0.85, iterate on prompt engineering)

### **Risk 3: Technical blocker on content hookup**
- **Mitigation:** Escalate immediately, pair program if needed
- **Decision point:** Day 1 (if not resolved by EOD, escalate)

### **Risk 4: No pilot responses**
- **Mitigation:** Expand outreach to 10 targets (not 5)
- **Decision point:** Day 7 (if <2 responses, expand list)

---

## 💰 **Budget & Resources**

### **Cost Breakdown:**
- **Content generation:** ~$5 (20 topics @ $0.25 each)
- **LLM API usage:** ~$20 (testing + iterations)
- **Total:** ~$25 for entire launch prep

### **Team Allocation:**
- **Engineering:** 20 hours (content hookup + testing + seeding support)
- **Content:** 16 hours (topic curation + quality checks)
- **Product/Marketing:** 12 hours (demo video + beta page + outreach)
- **Total:** ~48 hours (1 week of focused work)

## 🏁 **Decision Gate: Launch or Pivot?**

### **Green Light Criteria (Launch):**
- ✅ Content generation works reliably
- ✅ Quality scores >0.85 on all topics
- ✅ No critical bugs in core flow
- ✅ Demo materials ready
- ✅ At least 3 pilot targets identified

### **Yellow Light Criteria (Delay):**
- ⚠️ Quality scores 0.75-0.85 (needs improvement)
- ⚠️ Content generation >30s (too slow)
- ⚠️ Only 10 topics ready (not 20)
