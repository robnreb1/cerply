## 🧪 How to Test

### Start Servers:
```bash
# Terminal 1: API (with feature flags)
cd api
export FF_ENSEMBLE_GENERATION_V1=true
export FF_CONTENT_CANON_V1=true
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Web
cd web
npm run dev
```

### Test Conversational Flow:
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. You should see:
   - "Cerply" header (no icon)
   - Tagline: "Learn anything. Remember everything."
   - Welcome: "Hi, I'm Cerply. Shall we continue with your live topics, or would you like to learn something new?"
   - Clean input (no placeholder)
   - Shortcuts footer: Upload | Challenge | Catalog | Account | Progress

3. Try typing: **"astrophysics"**
4. Should get a response within 10 seconds OR error message

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "We have been unable to connect to the Cerply learning engine..."

**Possible causes:**
1. **API server not running**
   ```bash
   cd api
   export FF_ENSEMBLE_GENERATION_V1=true
   export FF_CONTENT_CANON_V1=true
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Feature flags not set**
   - Ensure `FF_ENSEMBLE_GENERATION_V1=true` in Terminal 1
   - Ensure `FF_CONTENT_CANON_V1=true` in Terminal 1

3. **Missing API keys**
   - Check `api/.env` for:
     - `OPENAI_API_KEY` (required for understanding endpoint)
     - `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (optional for full generation)
     - `GOOGLE_API_KEY` (optional for full generation)

4. **Database not running**
   ```bash
   # Check if PostgreSQL is running
   psql -h localhost -U postgres -d cerply_dev -c "SELECT 1"
   ```

5. **Port 8080 already in use**
   ```bash
   # Find and kill process on port 8080
   lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9
   ```

### Issue: Request takes too long

**Current timeout:** 10 seconds

If requests consistently take longer:
1. Check API logs for slow LLM calls
2. Verify OpenAI API is responding
3. Consider increasing timeout in `web/app/page.tsx` (line 67):
   ```typescript
   const timeoutId = setTimeout(() => controller.abort(), 10000); // 10 seconds
   ```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Phase 1: Validate UI ✅ (Just Completed)
- [x] Header updates
- [x] Welcome message
- [x] Input area cleanup
- [x] Shortcuts footer
- [x] Error handling

### Phase 2: Test Granularity Detection (Next)
Once API is running, test:
1. **Subject:** "Leadership" → Should suggest topics
2. **Topic:** "Effective Delegation" → Should explain module approach
3. **Module:** "SMART Goals" → Should offer to generate content

### Phase 3: Implement Shortcuts (Future)
- [ ] Upload: File picker integration
- [ ] Challenge: Modal form with pre-populated context
- [ ] Catalog: Navigate to `/catalog` page
- [ ] Account: Navigate to `/account` page
- [ ] Progress: Navigate to `/progress` page

### Phase 4: Content Generation Tests (Future)
- [ ] Generate 3 topics
- [ ] Validate quality >0.90
- [ ] Verify citations >95%
- [ ] Check cost <$0.30 per topic
