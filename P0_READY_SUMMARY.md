## Quick Start (For Experienced Users)

**If you're familiar with database migrations, use this:**

```bash
# 1. Set staging database URL
export DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:pass@staging-host:5432/cerply_staging"

# 2. Run migration (creates backup automatically)
cd /Users/robertford/Desktop/cerply-cursor-starter-v2-refresh
./scripts/run-content-hierarchy-migration.sh

# 3. Verify Epic 7 APIs work
cd api
npm run test:epic7-migration

# 4. If all green, you're done!
# If issues found, rollback:
# ./scripts/rollback-content-hierarchy-migration.sh
```

**For first-time users or detailed guidance, read `P0_EXECUTION_GUIDE.md` instead.**

---

## Pre-Execution Checklist

**Before running migration, verify:**

### Environment ✅
- [x] DATABASE_URL points to **staging** (not production)
- [x] PostgreSQL client (psql) installed
- [x] Node.js >= 20.x installed
- [x] API dependencies installed (`cd api && npm install`)

### Backups ✅
- [x] Manual backup created: `pg_dump $DATABASE_URL > backup_manual_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql`
- [x] Automatic backup will be created by migration script

### Scripts ✅

### Testing ✅
- [x] Test suite available (`npm run test:epic7-migration`)
- [x] Smoke test plan reviewed

## What Happens During Migration

### Phase 1: Schema Creation (5 minutes)
**File:** `016_content_hierarchy.sql`

Creates 9 new tables:
1. `subjects` - Top-level knowledge domains
2. `topics` - Content collection level (replaces tracks)
3. `modules_v2` - Content provision level (replaces modules)
4. `quizzes` - Assessment containers (new layer)
5. `questions` - Individual quiz items (replaces items)
6. `topic_assignments` - Who learns what (replaces team_track_subscriptions)
7. `topic_citations` - Research sources (for Epic 6.5)
8. `topic_secondary_sources` - Company-specific context (for Epic 6.8)
9. `topic_communications` - Assignment communications (for Epic 6.8)

### Phase 2: Data Migration (10-20 minutes)
**File:** `017_migrate_legacy_content.sql`

**Data transformations:**
- Tracks → Topics (1:1 ID mapping, preserve all fields)
- Modules → Modules_v2 (preserve provenance)
- Items → Questions (create default quizzes)
- Track subscriptions → Topic assignments

**Foreign key updates:**
- `learner_levels.track_id` → `topic_id`
- `certificates.track_id` → `topic_id`
- `team_analytics_snapshots.track_id` → `topic_id`
- `learner_analytics_snapshots.track_id` → `topic_id`
- `retention_curves.track_id` → `topic_id`
- `attempts.item_id` → `question_id`

**Safety measures:**
- Old tables renamed to `*_legacy` (not deleted)
- All changes in single transaction (COMMIT at end)
- Rollback section included in migration file

### Phase 3: Verification (2 minutes)
**Script:** `verify-content-hierarchy-migration.sh`

**6 automated checks:**
1. ✅ New tables created
2. ✅ Data counts match (no data loss)
3. ✅ Foreign keys updated
4. ✅ No orphaned records
5. ✅ Default subject created
6. ✅ Legacy tables renamed

### Phase 4: Testing (15 minutes)
**Test Suite:** `epic7-migration-compatibility.test.ts`

**15 tests verify:**
- Epic 7 gamification APIs work with topic_id
- Certificates work with topic_id
- Topic assignments work correctly
- Foreign key constraints enforced
- No data integrity issues
