  - LLM playback & confirmation loop ("I understand this is about...")
  - Multi-LLM ensemble generation
  - Best-of-breed content selection
  - Manager refinement UI
  - Generic vs proprietary content separation

### ✅ EPIC 7: Gamification & Certification System (12-16 hours) ⭐ **NEW**
- **What:** Levels, certificates, badges, manager notifications
- **Why:** Addresses your need for certificates, levels, and manager notifications
- **Covers:**
  - 5 learner levels (Novice → Learner → Practitioner → Expert → Master)
  - Auto-generated PDF certificates with Ed25519 signatures

  - 4 difficulty levels (L1 Recall → L2 Application → L3 Analysis → L4 Synthesis)
  - Performance signal tracking (correctness, latency, confusion, attempts)
  - Learning style detection (visual, verbal, kinesthetic)
  - Topic weakness identification (comprehension < 70%)
  - Auto-injection of more questions on weak topics

### ✅ EPIC 10: Enhanced Certification Workflow (8-10 hours)

## Questions Before We Start

1. **Priority:** Do you agree with Epic 5 (Slack) → Epic 6 (Ensemble) order?
2. **Effort:** 106-136 hours total seem reasonable for all features?
3. **Phases:** Should we tackle Phase 3 (Content Quality) before Phase 4 (Engagement)?

---

**Bottom Line:** 

🎯 All missing features from your earlier feedback are now documented as Epics 5-12

📋 Ready to implement in priority order

⏱️ Total: ~13-17 overnights of work

✅ No code written yet - all planning/documentation complete

**Ready to proceed?** Start with Epic 5 (Slack) using the existing implementation plan, or I can create detailed plans for Epics 6-9 next.
