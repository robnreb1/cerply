## ðŸŽ¯ **The Complete Picture**

Your insight is spot-on: **we need to prove learners actually learn and retain knowledge**, not just complete modules.

Here's how the epics fit together:

---

## **Epic Responsibilities (Clear Division)**

| Epic | What It Does | Testing Focus |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| **Epic 14: Manager Module Workflows** | Manager creates, refines, assigns, tracks | Usability (can managers use it?) |
| **Epic 15: Learning Module Delivery** | Basic structure (start, answer, complete) | Infrastructure (does it work?) |
| **Epic 16: Learning Experience Design** | Pedagogy, retention, adaptivity, testing | Efficacy (do learners actually learn?) |

---

## **Epic 14: Manager Module Workflows** (20-24h)

### **What Managers Do:**
1. **Create:** Generate module from conversational topic
2. **Refine:** Edit sections, questions, guidance
3. **Augment:** Add proprietary content (documents, case studies)
4. **Assign:** To teams (mandatory/optional, due dates)
5. **Track:** Progress, completion, performance

### **What Managers See:**
- Completion rates
- Average scores
- Time spent
- Struggling learners

### **What Managers DON'T Do (yet):**
- Design pedagogy (Epic 16)
- Understand retention patterns (Epic 16)
- Test learning efficacy (Epic 16)

**Focus:** Workflow and operations, not learning science.

---

## **Epic 15: Learning Module Delivery** (16-20h)

### **What Learners Do:**
1. **Discover:** View assigned modules

## **How They Work Together**

```
Epic 14 (Manager Workflows)
  â”œâ”€ Manager creates module
  â”œâ”€ Manager reviews question analytics (from Epic 16)
  â”œâ”€ Manager edits questions to improve clarity
  â””â”€ Manager sees retention patterns (from Epic 16)

Epic 15 (Module Delivery)
  â”œâ”€ Learner starts module
  â”œâ”€ Gets next question (spaced repetition from Epic 16)
  â”œâ”€ Answers question
  â”œâ”€ Receives contextual guidance (from Epic 16)
  â””â”€ Completes module

Epic 16 (Learning Design)
  â”œâ”€ Implements spaced repetition algorithm
  â”œâ”€ Generates contextual guidance (LLM)
  â”œâ”€ Tracks retention over time
  â”œâ”€ Provides analytics to managers (via Epic 14)
  â””â”€ Tests with real learners (validates efficacy)
```

## **Bottom Line**

You're absolutely right: **lesson design, testing, and genuine adaptivity are critical**.

**What we have now:**
- âœ… Content generation infrastructure
- âœ… Adaptive difficulty (basic)
- âœ… Conversational UI
- âœ… Manager analytics (basic)

**What we're adding:**
- ðŸš¨ **Epic 14:** Manager can create, refine, assign, track
- ðŸš¨ **Epic 15:** Learner can complete adaptive modules
- ðŸš¨ **Epic 16:** Learners actually learn and retain (proven with data)

**Without Epic 16, we're just an assignment tool. With it, we're a learning platform.**

---

## **Next Steps**

1. **Review Epic 16 prompt:** `docs/EPIC16_LEARNING_EXPERIENCE_DESIGN_PROMPT.md`
2. **Conduct your independent research:** Retention, application, memory mechanisms
3. **Update Epic 16 framework:** Integrate your findings
4. **Start Epic 13:** Agent Orchestrator (enables everything else)
5. **Begin Epic 16 framework work:** Can happen in parallel with Epic 13

---

**This is the complete picture. Epic 16 is the missing piece that proves our value proposition: learners don't just complete modules, they actually learn and improve.**
