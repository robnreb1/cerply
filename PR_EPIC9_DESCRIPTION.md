# Epic 9: True Adaptive Difficulty Engine üéØ

## Summary
Implements a comprehensive adaptive difficulty engine that dynamically adjusts content difficulty based on individual learner performance, learning style detection, and mastery tracking.

## Feature Flag
- `FF_ADAPTIVE_DIFFICULTY_V1` (default: false)

## What's New

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema
**Migration:** `api/drizzle/018_adaptive_difficulty.sql`

1. **`learner_profiles`** - Tracks learning preferences and performance patterns
   - `learning_style`: visual/verbal/kinesthetic/balanced/unknown
   - `avg_response_time`: rolling average in milliseconds
   - `consistency_score`: 0.00 - 1.00 performance consistency

2. **`topic_comprehension`** - Per-topic mastery tracking
   - `mastery_level`: 0.00 - 1.00 calculated mastery score
   - `difficulty_level`: recall/application/analysis/synthesis (Bloom's Taxonomy)
   - `attempts_count`, `correct_count`, `partial_credit_sum`
   - `confusion_count`: tracks confusion signals
   - `last_practiced_at`: for spaced repetition integration

3. **Extended `attempts` table**
   - `response_time_ms`: tracks question completion time
   - `difficulty_level`: records difficulty when question was attempted

### üéØ Core Service (`api/src/services/adaptive.ts`)
- **`calculateMasteryLevel`**: Time-weighted scoring with 30-day exponential decay
- **`recommendDifficultyLevel`**: Bloom's Taxonomy mapping based on mastery (0-25% ‚Üí Recall, 25-60% ‚Üí Application, 60-85% ‚Üí Analysis, 85%+ ‚Üí Synthesis)
- **`detectLearningStyle`**: Pattern recognition from confusion signals
- **`identifyWeakTopics`**: Flags topics with mastery < 0.70
- **`updateLearnerProfile`**: Maintains rolling averages and consistency metrics
- **`recordAttemptForAdaptive`**: Updates mastery after each attempt

### üåê API Endpoints (`api/src/routes/adaptive.ts`)

1. **`GET /api/adaptive/profile/:userId`** (admin/manager/learner)
   - Returns learner profile with learning style and performance metrics
   - Response: `{ success, profile: { userId, learningStyle, avgResponseTime, consistencyScore, ... } }`

2. **`GET /api/adaptive/topics/:topicId/difficulty/:userId`** (admin/manager/learner)
   - Recommends next difficulty level for a topic
   - Response: `{ success, topicId, userId, recommendedDifficulty, currentMastery, attemptsCount }`

3. **`POST /api/adaptive/attempt`** (admin/manager/learner)
   - Records an attempt and updates mastery
   - Body: `{ userId, topicId, correct, partialCredit?, responseTimeMs?, difficultyLevel? }`
   - Response: `{ success, mastery: { masteryLevel, difficultyLevel, attemptsCount, ... } }`

4. **`GET /api/adaptive/analytics/:userId`** (admin/manager/learner)
   - Returns comprehensive analytics: weak topics, overall mastery, recent practice
   - Response: `{ success, analytics: { weakTopics[], averageMastery, topicsCount, recentPractice[] } }`

### üîó Integration Points

1. **Epic 7 (Gamification)** - Ready for achievement/badge integration
   - Mastery milestones (50%, 75%, 100%)
   - Learning style badges
   - Consistency streaks

2. **Epic 8 (Confusion Tracking)** - Active integration
   - Confusion signals feed into learning style detection
   - Confusion counts tracked per topic

3. **P0 (Content Hierarchy)** - Full integration
   - Topic-based mastery tracking
   - Supports 5-tier hierarchy (Subject ‚Üí Topic ‚Üí Module ‚Üí Quiz ‚Üí Question)

4. **`/api/learn/submit`** - Automatic adaptive tracking
   - Every attempt now updates mastery via `recordAttemptForAdaptive`

### üß† Intent Router Enhancement
`api/src/services/intent-router.ts` now recognizes:
- "what's hard for me?" ‚Üí adaptive analytics
- "my weak topics?" ‚Üí weak topic identification
- "my learning style?" ‚Üí learning style report
- "what's my mastery?" ‚Üí mastery overview

### ‚úÖ Testing
- **25 unit tests** in `api/tests/adaptive.test.ts`
  - All service functions (happy paths + edge cases)
  - Mastery calculation edge cases (decay, zero attempts, partial credit)
  - Learning style detection patterns
- **8 smoke test curls** in `api/scripts/smoke-adaptive.sh`

## Configuration Variables
```bash
# Adaptive Engine Settings
ADAPTIVE_MIN_DIFFICULTY=recall     # Minimum difficulty level
ADAPTIVE_MAX_DIFFICULTY=synthesis  # Maximum difficulty level
WEAK_TOPIC_THRESHOLD=0.70          # Mastery threshold for weak topics
MASTERY_DECAY_DAYS=30              # Half-life for time decay
```

## Test the Endpoints

### 1. Get Learner Profile
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/adaptive/profile/usr_demo_001" \
  -H "x-user-id: usr_demo_001" \
  -H "x-user-role: learner"
```

### 2. Get Recommended Difficulty
```bash
TOPIC_ID="123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000"
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/adaptive/topics/${TOPIC_ID}/difficulty/usr_demo_001" \
  -H "x-user-id: usr_demo_001" \
  -H "x-user-role: learner"
```

### 3. Record an Attempt
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/api/adaptive/attempt" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "x-user-id: usr_demo_001" \
  -H "x-user-role: learner" \
  -d '{
    "userId": "usr_demo_001",
    "topicId": "123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000",
    "correct": true,
    "partialCredit": 1.0,
    "responseTimeMs": 15000,
    "difficultyLevel": "application"
  }'
```

### 4. Get Analytics
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/api/adaptive/analytics/usr_demo_001" \
  -H "x-user-id: usr_demo_001" \
  -H "x-user-role: learner"
```
