## Browser Test Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **Start the web app:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/robertford/Desktop/cerply-cursor-starter-v2-refresh/web
   npm run dev
   # Runs on http://localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Start the marketing site:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/robertford/Desktop/cerply-cursor-starter-v2-refresh/web-marketing
   npm run dev  
   # Runs on http://localhost:3002
   ```

---

## Test Scenario 1: Anonymous User Redirection

### Step 1: Open Incognito/Private Window

**Chrome:** `Cmd+Shift+N` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+N` (Windows)  
**Firefox:** `Cmd+Shift+P` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`  
**Safari:** `File > New Private Window`

### Step 2: Access Protected Route

Visit: **http://localhost:3000/learn**

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Browser redirects to: `http://localhost:3000/login?from=%2Flearn`
- ✅ Login page displays with "Enterprise Login" heading
- ✅ Email input placeholder shows `your.name@organization.com`
- ✅ Button says "Continue with Enterprise Login"

**What This Proves:**
- Middleware is intercepting unauthenticated requests
- Protected routes are not accessible anonymously
- User is sent to login, not marketing site
- Return path is preserved for post-login redirect

### Step 3: Try Other Protected Routes

Test these URLs (all should redirect to login):

- http://localhost:3000/ (home)
- http://localhost:3000/curate
- http://localhost:3000/learn
- http://localhost:3000/analytics

**Expected:** All redirect to `/login?from=<path>`

---

## Test Scenario 2: Allowlisted Routes

These routes should be accessible WITHOUT authentication:

### Test 1: Login Page
Visit: **http://localhost:3000/login**

**Expected:**
- ✅ Page loads (no redirect)
- ✅ Shows "Enterprise Login" form
- ✅ No authentication required to view

### Test 2: Unauthorized Page
Visit: **http://localhost:3000/unauthorized**

**Expected:**
- ✅ Page loads (no redirect)
- ✅ Shows "Access Restricted" message
- ✅ Has "Try Logging In Again" button

### Test 3: API Health Check
Visit: **http://localhost:3000/api/health**

**Expected:**
- ✅ Returns JSON: `{"ok":true,...}` (if API running)
- ✅ Or proxy error if API not running (acceptable for this test)

---

## Test Scenario 3: Marketing Site (Public)

### Visit Marketing Site
Open: **http://localhost:3002/**

**Expected Result:**
- ✅ Loads without authentication
- ✅ Shows "Your Team's Institutional Memory" heading
- ✅ Has "Request a Demo" button
- ✅ B2B-focused copy (teams, organization, enterprise)
- ✅ No consumer language ("you" → "your team")

**What This Proves:**
- Marketing site is completely open
- Separate from gated app
- B2B positioning from Epic 1

---

## Test Scenario 4: With Authentication (Manual)

### Step 1: Login

1. Visit: http://localhost:3000/login
2. Enter any email (e.g., `test@example.com`)
3. Click "Continue with Enterprise Login"

**Expected:**
- Form submits
- Shows "Sending magic link..." or similar
- (Full login flow requires API backend with SSO configured)

### Step 2: Simulated Authenticated State

For full test with database:

1. Start API with database
2. Use mock SSO login
3. Get session cookie
4. Visit protected route
5. Should see content (no redirect)

**Without Database (Current State):**
- Login form displays correctly ✅
- Full auth flow requires PostgreSQL + migration
- Will be tested in CI/staging

---

## Test Scenario 5: Production (When Deployed)

### Production URLs

**App:** https://app.cerply.com  
**Marketing:** https://www.cerply.com

### Test in Production

1. Open incognito window
2. Visit: https://app.cerply.com/learn
3. **Expected:** Redirect to https://app.cerply.com/login?from=%2Flearn
4. Visit: https://www.cerply.com
5. **Expected:** Marketing site loads (no redirect)

---

## Middleware Configuration

The gating is implemented in `web/middleware.ts`:

### Allowlisted Routes (No Auth Required)
```typescript
- /login
- /unauthorized  
- /api/health
- /api/auth/*
- /debug/env
```

### Protected Routes (Auth Required)
```typescript
- / (home)
- /learn
- /curate
- /analytics
- /manager/*
- All other routes
```

### Environment Variables

```bash
# web/.env.local
MARKETING_BASE_URL=https://www.cerply.com
APP_ALLOWLIST_ROUTES=/login,/unauthorized,/api/health,/api/auth,/debug/env
BETA_INVITE_CODES=demo123,friend456  # Optional dev codes
```

---

## What Gets Checked

The middleware verifies in order:

1. **Path in allowlist?** → Allow
2. **Has session cookie (`cerply.sid`)?** → Allow
3. **Has beta invite code?** → Set cookie + Allow
4. **None of above?** → Redirect to `/login?from=<path>`

---

## Security Considerations

### ✅ What's Protected
- All app routes require authentication
- Session-based access control
- Redirect preserves intended destination
- Marketing site remains public

### ✅ What's Allowed
- Login page (must be accessible)
- Unauthorized page (error handling)
- Health checks (monitoring)
- Auth API endpoints (login flow)

### 🔒 Future Enhancements (Epic 2+)
- SSO integration (Google, SAML)
- Role-based access (admin, manager, learner)
- Team membership validation
- Organization domain checking

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Not redirecting"

**Check:**
1. Are you using incognito/private window?
2. Do you have a session cookie from previous login?
3. Is the middleware file present in `web/middleware.ts`?
4. Check browser console for errors

**Solution:**
- Clear all cookies for localhost:3000
- Use fresh incognito window
- Verify middleware.ts exists

### Issue: "Redirects to wrong place"

**Check:**
- `MARKETING_BASE_URL` in web/.env.local
- Middleware redirect logic

**Solution:**
- For local testing, it redirects to `/login` (not marketing site)
- This is correct B2B behavior from Epic 1

### Issue: "Marketing site not loading"

**Check:**
- Is port 3002 in use? `lsof -i :3002`
- Is web-marketing server running?

**Solution:**
```bash
cd web-marketing
npm run dev
```

## CI/Staging Testing

### Automated E2E Tests

We have Playwright E2E tests for gating:

**File:** `web/e2e/enterprise-auth.spec.ts`

**Tests:**
- ✅ Anonymous redirect to /login
- ✅ Login page accessible
- ✅ Unauthorized page accessible
- ✅ Root redirect to /login
- ✅ Health endpoint accessible
- ✅ Auth API endpoints accessible

**Run tests:**
```bash
cd web
npx playwright test e2e/enterprise-auth.spec.ts
```
