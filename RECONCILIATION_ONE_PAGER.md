## Epic Quality Scores

| Epic | Grade | Status | Notes |
|------|-------|--------|-------|
| **6/6.5** | A- | In Progress | Model mismatch, migration header missing |
| **7** | A+ | Complete | 100% ADR compliance, 8 new patterns |
| **Platform v1** | B+ | Complete | High quality, was undocumented (now fixed) |
| **8** | B- | Phase 1 | FSD overstated (now fixed), test coverage 20% |
| **Average** | **B+** | - | Strong architecture, test coverage needs work |

---

## Code Fixes Needed (11 hours)

### Priority 2: Compliance (2h, non-blocking)
- [ ] Add migration header to `010_research_citations.sql` (5 min)
- [ ] Resolve `FF_CONTENT_CANON_V1` feature flag conflict (30 min)
- [ ] Add RBAC or document exception for Epic 6 routes (1h)

### Priority 3: Quality (9h, not blocking Epic 9)
- [ ] Increase Epic 7 test coverage 60% → 80% (3h)
- [ ] Increase Epic 8 test coverage 20% → 80% (4h) ⚠️ **Blocks Epic 8 Phase 2-8**
- [ ] Add JSDoc comments to all services (2h)

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Epics Documented** | 10/13 (77%) | 13/13 (100%) | +23% ✅ |
| **Env Vars Registered** | 8 | 24 | +16 ✅ |
| **Architecture Patterns** | 8 | 26 | +18 ✅ |
| **Test Coverage (avg)** | 57% | 57% | 0% (fixes needed) ⚠️ |

---

## 18 New Patterns Standardized

**Production Operations (8):** Idempotency, audit logging, pagination, UUID validation, admin gating, cleanup crons, revocation, CI tests

**Content Quality (3):** Lazy LLM init, word boundary regex, stop words filtering

**Platform (5):** Canon architecture, quality floor, cost orchestration, interaction engine, platform docs

**Dev Experience (2):** `getSessionOrMock()`, staging vs production schema

---

## Epic 9 Status

✅ **READY TO PROCEED**

- Master Plan v1.1 provides accurate guidance
- Epic 0 (Platform v1) documented as prerequisite
- Epic 8 Phase 1 complete (confusion tracking foundation ready)
- No blocking code fixes

**Implementation Prompt:** `EPIC9_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md` (already exists)

---

## Next Actions

**For You:**
1. ✅ Review reconciliation documents (start with this one, then RECONCILIATION_DELIVERABLES.md)
2. ⚠️ **Decision:** Apply ADR v1.1 updates now or defer? (see ADR_UPDATES_v1.1_SUMMARY.md)
3. ✅ Approve master document updates (EPIC_MASTER_PLAN v1.1, FSD §29)
4. ⚠️ Assign Priority 2 fixes (~2h) before Epic 9 complete

**For Development:**
1. Create GitHub issues for 6 code fixes (Priority 2 + 3)
2. Complete Priority 2 fixes (~2h, non-blocking)
3. Schedule Priority 3 fixes (~9h, before production)

**For Epic 9 Agent:**
1. Read EPIC_MASTER_PLAN.md v1.1
2. Read ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md v1.1
3. Implement per EPIC9_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md
4. Run reconciliation after completion

## Governance Status

**Master Documents:**
- ✅ EPIC_MASTER_PLAN.md v1.1 (LOCKED, updated)
- ⚠️ ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md v1.1 (LOCKED, version updated, detailed updates pending approval)
- ✅ docs/functional-spec.md (§29 fixed, accurate)
- ✅ IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md v1.0 (LOCKED)
- ✅ AGENT_WORKFLOW.md v1.0 (LOCKED)

**Coverage:**
- ✅ 13/13 epics documented (100%)
- ✅ All env vars registered (24 total)
- ✅ All patterns documented (26 total)
- ✅ Full BRD/FSD traceability maintained

---

## Recommendation

**Proceed with Epic 9 immediately.** All governance is in place, documentation is accurate, and no code fixes are blocking. Priority 2/3 fixes can be done in parallel or after Epic 9.
