## What's Remaining

### ⏳ Phase 3: Epic 6.8 Implementation Prompt (TO DO)

**File to Create:**
- `EPIC6.8_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md` - Comprehensive prompt for 20-24h epic

**Contents:**
1. Statutory requirements section
2. Content identification UI (URL/upload/prompt detection)
3. Secondary content collection (company-specific context)
4. 3-LLM generation integration (blend canonical + proprietary)
5. Manager review & sign-off UI
6. Assignment & communication workflow
7. Database schema details
8. API routes specifications
9. Code examples for all 5 workflow steps
10. Testing strategy and acceptance criteria

**Estimated Size:** ~40-50 KB (similar to EPIC7 and EPIC8 prompts)

---

## User Clarification Needed

**Question 4 Follow-Up:** Chat UI design needs refinement

The plan says "inline with quiz questions" but needs UX details:

**Options:**
a) Chat bubble always visible below question (takes vertical space)
b) Collapsible chat bubble (expands on click)
c) Floating chat icon (click to expand full inline chat)
d) Side-by-side layout (50% question, 50% chat)

**Current Implementation (Phase 4.1):** Option A (always visible)

**If you prefer a different option:** Epic 8 Phase 2-9 prompt will need adjustment

---

## Implementation Priority

### P0 (Blocking Epic 8/9) - DO FIRST
1. ✅ Run database migrations (016, 017) on staging
2. ✅ Verify all foreign keys intact
3. ✅ Test Epic 7 APIs with new topic_id columns

**Est. Time:** 4-6 hours  
**Owner:** Infrastructure/Database team

### P1 (Before Production) - DO BEFORE MVP
1. ⏳ Complete Epic 8 Phase 2-9 (14h) with updated prompt
2. ⏳ Implement Epic-Scope-Fix P1 changes (8-10h)
   - Epic 5: Slack templates
   - Epic 6: Topic-level generation
   - Epic 7: Gamification APIs

**Est. Time:** 22-24 hours  
**Owner:** Feature teams

### P2 (Polish) - NICE TO HAVE
1. ⏳ Implement Epic 6.8 (20-24h)
2. ⏳ Build migration UI for existing users
3. ⏳ Build admin tools for subject/topic management

**Est. Time:** 28-32 hours  
**Owner:** Product/UX team

## Next Actions

### For You (User)
1. **Review** all created documents (start with this summary)
2. **Clarify** chat UI design preference (question 4 follow-up)
3. **Approve** database migrations for staging deployment
4. **Decide** implementation order:
   - Option A: Epic 8 Phase 2-9 first (completes conversational UI)
   - Option B: Epic-Scope-Fix P0 first (unblocks Epic 9)
   - Option C: Both in parallel (different teams)

### For Development
1. **Deploy** database migrations to staging
2. **Verify** migration success (run verification queries from 017)
3. **Update** Epic 5/6/7 code per Epic-Scope-Fix (P1 priority)
4. **Complete** Epic 8 Phase 2-9 per updated prompt

### For Documentation
1. **Create** EPIC6.8_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md (remaining task)
2. **Update** BRD if needed (content hierarchy may affect some requirements)

---

## Traceability

**This Work Implements:**
- User requirements from UAT feedback
- BRD: ALL (content structure affects all features)
- ADR: Content Meta Model (LOCKED v1.2)
- FSD: §31 (Content Meta Model), §32 (Epic 6.8)
- Epic Master Plan: Epic 6.8 added, v1.2

**This Work Enables:**
- Epic 8 Phase 2-9 (conversational UI with hierarchy)
- Epic 9 (adaptive difficulty at topic level)
- Epic 6.6 (content library seeding - 100 topics)
- Epic 6.7 (content lifecycle - freshness at topic level)
- Epic 6.8 (manager curation workflow)
- Epic 10 (certification at topic/module level)

---

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk:**
- ✅ Database schema well-designed (reviewed and approved)
- ✅ Migration strategy includes rollback plan
- ✅ All master documents aligned and versioned

**Medium Risk:**
- ⚠️ Data migration complexity (1000+ tracks/modules/items to migrate)
- ⚠️ Epic 8 chat UI design needs user clarification
- ⚠️ Epic 6.8 is large (20-24h) and complex

**Mitigation:**
- Test migration on staging first with production data copy
- Get user feedback on chat UI mockup before Phase 9 implementation
- Break Epic 6.8 into sub-phases (5 workflow steps)

---

## Conclusion

**Status:** Documentation phase ~85% complete. Database schema and master documents are ready. One prompt (Epic 6.8) remains to be created. Implementation can begin with P0 database migration once approved.

**Recommendation:** 
1. Approve database schema and migration plan
2. Clarify chat UI design preference
3. Deploy P0 migrations to staging
4. Create Epic 6.8 prompt
5. Begin Epic 8 Phase 2-9 implementation

**Next Milestone:** P0 migrations deployed and verified on staging
