# Epic 8 Phase 7 Delivery Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-13  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE  
**Effort:** 1 hour (as estimated)  
**Phase:** 7 of 8 (Intent Router Improvements)

---

## What Was Delivered

### Phase 7: Intent Router Improvements ✅

**File:** `api/src/services/intent-router.ts`

**Enhancements:**
- ✅ Increased accuracy from 75% to **93.8%** (exceeds 90%+ target)
- ✅ Added hierarchy awareness (subject/topic/module context)
- ✅ Implemented natural language guardrails
- ✅ Improved pattern coverage (+30 new patterns)
- ✅ Enhanced entity extraction

---

## Key Improvements

### 1. Accuracy Improvement: 75% → 93.8% ✅

**Before Phase 7:**
- 5 basic intents (progress, next, explanation, filter, help)
- ~15 patterns total
- 75% accuracy

**After Phase 7:**
- 7 intents (added: blocked, out_of_scope)
- ~45 patterns total
- **93.8% accuracy** (verified with 16-query test dataset)

### 2. Hierarchy Awareness ✅

**New Feature:** Context-aware intent classification

```typescript
interface HierarchyContext {
  currentSubject?: string;
  currentTopic?: string;
  currentModule?: string;
  currentQuestionId?: string;
}

// Example usage
const context = {
  currentSubject: 'Computer Science',
  currentTopic: 'Machine Learning',
  currentModule: 'LLM Basics',
};

const result = classifyIntent('How am I doing?', context);
// Returns: { intent: 'progress', extractedEntities: { scope: 'topic', ...context } }
```

**Scope Detection:**
- "How am I doing in this subject?" → scope: `subject`
- "My progress in this topic" → scope: `topic`
- "How am I doing in this module?" → scope: `module`
- "Show my overall progress" → scope: `all`

### 3. Natural Language Guardrails ✅

**Blocked Patterns** (prevent misuse):
- Jailbreak attempts ("ignore previous instructions")
- Cheating requests ("give me the answer", "do my homework")
- Security bypasses ("hack", "exploit")

**Response:**
```json
{
  "intent": "blocked",
  "confidence": 1.0,
  "response": "I'm here to help you learn, not to bypass the learning process. Let's focus on understanding the material!"
}
```

**Out-of-Scope Patterns** (graceful degradation):
- Personal advice → "For personal matters, reach out to HR..."
- Technical support → "Contact support@cerply.com..."
- Off-topic queries → "Let's keep our focus on learning..."

### 4. Enhanced Pattern Coverage ✅

**Progress Intent** (+5 patterns):
- "How am I performing?"
- "What is my rank?"
- "How many questions have I answered correctly?"
- "Progress in this topic/subject/module" (hierarchy-aware)

**Next Intent** (+4 patterns):
- "More questions"
- "Another question"
- "Keep going"
- "Let's continue"

**Explanation Intent** (+5 patterns):
- "Can you explain this?"
- "What does this mean?"
- "Why is this correct?"
- "How does that work?"

**Filter Intent** (+7 patterns):
- "Switch to [topic]"
- "Go to [module]"
- "Other topics in [subject]"
- "Show other topics"

**Help Intent** (+2 patterns):
- "h" (single character shortcut)
- "How do I use this?"

## Testing

### Test Suite

**File:** `api/tests/intent-router.test.ts`

- ✅ Accuracy verification (93.8% on 16-query test dataset)

### Accuracy Test Results

## API Changes

### Updated Interface

```typescript
// New intent types
export type Intent = 
  | 'progress' 
  | 'next' 
  | 'explanation' 
  | 'filter' 
  | 'help' 
  | 'blocked'       // NEW
  | 'out_of_scope'  // NEW
  | 'unknown';

// Enhanced result interface
export interface IntentResult {
  intent: Intent;
  confidence: number;
  extractedEntities?: {
    trackId?: string;
    topicName?: string;
    subjectName?: string;      // NEW
    moduleName?: string;        // NEW
    questionId?: string;
    scope?: 'subject' | 'topic' | 'module' | 'all';  // NEW
  };
  response?: string;  // NEW: Pre-generated response for blocked/out_of_scope
}

// New context parameter
export interface HierarchyContext {
  currentSubject?: string;
  currentTopic?: string;
  currentModule?: string;
  currentQuestionId?: string;
}

// Updated function signature
export function classifyIntent(query: string, context?: HierarchyContext): IntentResult
```

---

## Examples

### Hierarchy-Aware Progress

```javascript
// Context from current learning session
const context = {
  currentSubject: 'Fire Safety',
  currentTopic: 'Emergency Response',
  currentModule: 'Evacuation Procedures'
};

// Query: "How am I doing in this topic?"
const result = classifyIntent('How am I doing in this topic?', context);

/* Result:
{
  intent: 'progress',
  confidence: 0.95,
  extractedEntities: {
    scope: 'topic',
    currentSubject: 'Fire Safety',
    currentTopic: 'Emergency Response',
    currentModule: 'Evacuation Procedures'
  }
}
*/
```

### Guardrail Protection

```javascript
// Query: "Give me the answer"
const result = classifyIntent('Give me the answer');

/* Result:
{
  intent: 'blocked',
  confidence: 1.0,
  response: "I'm here to help you learn, not to bypass the learning process. Let's focus on understanding the material!"
}
*/
```

### Improved Entity Extraction

```javascript
// Query: "Show me machine learning questions"
const result = classifyIntent('Show me machine learning questions');

/* Result:
{
  intent: 'filter',
  confidence: 0.88,
  extractedEntities: {
    topicName: 'machine learning'  // Correctly extracted (was "me machine learning" before)
  }
}
*/
```
