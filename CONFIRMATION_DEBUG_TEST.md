# Confirmation Flow Debug Test

## Steps to Test:

### 1. Open Browser DevTools
1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Press **F12** (or Cmd+Option+I on Mac)
3. Click on the **Console** tab
4. Make sure console is clear

### 2. Test the Confirmation Flow
1. Type: **"I want to be a successful entrepreneur"**
2. Click Send
3. Wait for response (should ask for confirmation)
4. **Check the Console** - look for any debug logs
5. Type: **"yes"**
6. Click Send
7. **Check the Console** - you should see:
   ```
   [Cerply Debug] lastAssistantMessage awaitingConfirmation: true
   [Cerply Debug] userInput: yes
   [Cerply Debug] isAffirmative: true
   ```

### 3. What Should Happen:

**If confirmation works:**
- You should see "Excellent! This is a valuable skill to develop. I'm now structuring your learning path..."
- Console should show `awaitingConfirmation: true` and `isAffirmative: true`

**If confirmation fails:**
- It will treat "yes" as a new learning request
- Console might show `awaitingConfirmation: false` or `isAffirmative: false`

### 4. Send Me the Console Output

Copy and paste the console logs here so we can debug!

## Alternative Test - Try These Confirmations:

After the initial question, try each of these:
- "yes"
- "yeah"  
- "sure"
- "ok"
- "confirmed"
- "go ahead"

At least one should work if the pattern matching is correct.

---

## Expected Behavior:

1. **First message:** "I want to be X" → Cerply asks for confirmation
2. **Second message:** "yes" → Cerply says "Excellent! I'm structuring..." (WITHOUT calling the API again)
3. **No new understanding API call** should happen for "yes"

Check the Network tab too - you should see:
- 1st message: POST to `/api/content/understand` (~2-15 seconds)
- 2nd message: NO API call (instant response)

**Let me know what you see in the console!**
