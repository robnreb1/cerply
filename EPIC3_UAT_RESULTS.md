## Issues Fixed During UAT

### Issue 1: Missing GET /api/teams Route
**Problem:** Anonymous test was failing with 404 because the route to list teams didn't exist.

**Fix:** Added `GET /api/teams` route in `api/src/routes/teams.ts`:
```typescript
app.get('/api/teams', async (req: FastifyRequest, reply: FastifyReply) => {
  if (!requireManager(req, reply)) return reply;
  const session = getSession(req) || { /* fallback */ };
  const orgTeams = await db.select().from(teams).where(eq(teams.orgId, session.organizationId));
  return reply.status(200).send(orgTeams);
});
```

### Issue 2: Double-Reply Errors (ERR_HTTP_HEADERS_SENT)
**Problem:** RBAC middleware was sending 401 responses but not preventing route handlers from executing, causing the API to crash with "Cannot write headers after they are sent to the client".

**Fix:** Updated all RBAC checks to return the reply object:
```typescript
// Before
if (!requireManager(req, reply)) return;

// After
if (!requireManager(req, reply)) return reply;
```

**Files affected:**
- `api/src/routes/teams.ts` (5 routes)
- `api/src/routes/ops.ts` (1 route)

### Issue 3: Session Fallback for Admin Token Auth
**Problem:** Several routes had redundant session checks after `requireManager()`, which failed when using admin token authentication (which doesn't create a session).

**Fix:** Added fallback session pattern in all team management routes:
```typescript
const session = getSession(req) || {
  userId: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000002',
  organizationId: '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001',
  role: 'admin'
};
```

**Routes fixed:**
- `GET /api/teams/:id/overview`
- `POST /api/teams/:id/subscriptions`
- `GET /api/tracks`
