**Status:** Research-backed learning science fully integrated  
**Impact:** Evidence-based pedagogy, 10 proven techniques, 1 myth explicitly avoided

---

## 🎯 **What Was Integrated**

Your research on evidence-based learning (consensus, 2025) has been fully integrated into Epic 16.

### **✅ 10 Proven Techniques (Implemented in MVP)**

| # | Technique | Evidence | Implementation | Priority |
|---|-----------|----------|----------------|----------|
| 1 | **Retrieval Practice** | Hundreds of studies, most effective | Free-text > MCQ, frequent testing | 🏆 Highest |
| 2 | **Spaced Repetition** | Meta-analyses, robust | SM-2 algorithm, 1d/3d/7d/14d intervals | 🏆 Highest |
| 3 | **Interleaving** | Beats blocking for transfer | Mix concepts, progressive increase | 🏆 High |
| 4 | **Worked Examples → Fading** | Hundreds of CLT replications | Full → partial → complete | 🆕 New |
| 5 | **Elaborated Feedback** | Recent meta-analyses | What/why/how, Socratic dialogue | ✅ Enhanced |
| 6 | **Self-Explanation** | Moderate reliable gains | After every 3rd question | 🆕 New |
| 7 | **Microlearning** | With spacing & retrieval | 5-10 min chunks + retrieval | ✅ Confirmed |
| 8 | **AI Tutoring** | Step-based > explainers | LLM for Socratic dialogue | ✅ Targeted |
| 9 | **Elo-Based Adaptivity** | Production-validated (IRT) | Target 70-80% success | 🆕 New |
| 10 | **Desirable Difficulties** | Bjork's work, replicated | Elo targeting, delayed testing | ✅ Confirmed |

### **❌ 1 Myth Explicitly Avoided**

| Myth | Why It's Wrong | What We Do Instead |
|------|---------------|-------------------|
| **"Learning Styles" (VAK)** | No evidence matching helps | Multiple representations for everyone |

**Critical:** Epic 16 explicitly prohibits building "learning style" detection. Time saved is invested in proven techniques above.

- 3-4 self-explanation prompts
- 2-3 comparison questions
- 0-2 MCQ (last resort)

#### **Adaptive Mechanisms (Evidence-Based)**

- **Slightly delayed for conceptual tasks** (e.g., "Why is X effective?")
- Always include:
  1. What was incorrect/correct
  2. Why (the reasoning)
  3. How to improve (next steps)

### **2. Epic 17: Multimodal Learning Experience (Post-MVP)**
**File:** `docs/EPIC17_MULTIMODAL_LEARNING_PROMPT.md`

**Status:** Created as separate post-MVP epic

**What's Included:**

- Content types: Video, interactive diagrams, animations, simulations
- Manager upload workflows
- Accessibility requirements (captions, transcripts)
- Analytics for multimedia engagement
- A/B testing protocol (validate 10-15% retention improvement)

**Why Post-MVP:**
- Requires video production infrastructure
- MVP focuses on text-based, retrieval-focused learning first
- Add multimedia only after validating core efficacy

---

## 🎯 **Epic 16 MVP Focus (What We Build)**

Based on your research, Epic 16 implements:

1. ✅ **Retrieval practice as default** (free-text > MCQ)
2. ✅ **Spaced repetition** (SM-2 algorithm, 1d/3d/7d/14d)
3. ✅ **Interleaving** (mix related concepts, progressive increase)
4. ✅ **Worked examples with fading** (full → partial → complete)
5. ✅ **Elaborated, timely feedback** (what/why/how, Socratic dialogue)
6. ✅ **Self-explanation prompts** (after every 3rd question)
7. ✅ **Microlearning structure** (5-10 min chunks + retrieval)
8. ✅ **AI assistance** (LLM for feedback, not scoring)
9. ✅ **Elo-based adaptivity** (70-80% success targeting)
10. ⛔ **NO learning styles matching** (proven myth)

**Deferred to Post-MVP:**
- Multimedia learning principles (Epic 17)
- Peer learning / collaborative modules (Epic 18)

## 📊 **Implementation Highlights**

### **Elo-Based Adaptivity (NEW)** 🆕

Replaces Epic 9's basic difficulty adjustment with production-validated Elo rating system:

```typescript
// Each question has an Elo rating (difficulty)
// Each learner has an Elo rating (ability)

// Select next question targeting 70-80% success probability
function selectNextQuestion(learnerRating, availableQuestions) {
  const targetExpectedScore = 0.75; // Optimal desirable difficulty
  
  return availableQuestions
    .map(q => ({
      question: q,
      expectedScore: 1 / (1 + Math.pow(10, (q.eloRating - learnerRating) / 400)),
    }))
    .sort((a, b) => 
      Math.abs(a.expectedScore - targetExpectedScore) - 
      Math.abs(b.expectedScore - targetExpectedScore)
    )[0].question;
}
```

**Advantages:**
- No training data required (cold-start solved)
- Real-time updates (no batch retraining)
- Interpretable ratings
- Production-validated (millions of users)

---

### **Worked Examples with Fading (NEW)** 🆕

**Step 1: Full Worked Example**
```
Problem: A team member misses a deadline. How do you handle it?

Solution:
1. Schedule 1-1 within 24 hours (timely, private)
2. Ask open questions: "What happened?"
3. Identify barriers (personal? unclear requirements?)
4. Agree on action plan with ownership
5. Set checkpoint for accountability
```

**Step 2: Partial Fade**
```
Problem: [New scenario]
Steps 1-3 provided, you complete 4-5
```

**Step 3: Full Completion**
```
Problem: [New scenario]
Apply the framework independently
```

**Triggers:**
- 80%+ success on partial → advance to full
- < 60% success on full → regress to partial

---

### **Interleaving Adaptation (NEW)** 🆕

Progressive increase based on module progress:

| Progress | Blocking | Interleaving | Why |
|----------|----------|--------------|-----|
| < 30% | 70% | 30% | Novices need some blocking |
| 30-70% | 50% | 50% | Balance |
| > 70% | 20% | 80% | Advanced learners benefit from discrimination |

**Always interleave during spaced repetition** (critical for long-term retention).

---

### **Self-Explanation Prompts (NEW)** 🆕

After every 3rd question:

```
Question: [After answering correctly]
"Explain why you chose that answer in 1-2 sentences."

Learner: "I chose B because..."

Follow-up: "Good. How would your answer differ if the team member was new vs. experienced?"

[Forces comparison, nuance, transfer]
```

**LLM evaluates explanation quality:**
- Shallow → Prompt deeper: "Can you elaborate on why that matters?"
- Deep → Reinforce: "Excellent insight. You've identified the key trade-off."

## 📋 **What's NOT in MVP (By Design)**

### **Deferred to Epic 17 (Post-MVP):**
- ❌ Multimedia learning principles (video, animation)
- ❌ Requires video production infrastructure
- ❌ Add ONLY after validating text-based efficacy

### **Explicitly Avoided (Myth):**
- ⛔ "Learning styles" matching (VAK)
- ⛔ No evidence it helps
- ⛔ Time wasted is better spent on proven techniques

**Focus:** Build a solid, evidence-based foundation with Epic 16. Enhance with multimedia (Epic 17) only after proving core efficacy.
