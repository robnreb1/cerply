- ✅ Idempotency service (X-Idempotency-Key support)
- ✅ RBAC middleware (extended from Epic 2, no changes needed)
- ✅ CSV content-type parser registered

### Testing
- ✅ Unit tests: `api/tests/team-mgmt.test.ts` (comprehensive coverage)
- ✅ Smoke test: `api/scripts/smoke-team-mgmt.sh` (8 test scenarios)
- ✅ UAT guide: `docs/uat/EPIC3_UAT.md` (9 manual test scenarios)

### Event Emission
- ✅ `team.created`
- ✅ `member.added`
- ✅ `subscription.created`

## 🔶 IN PROGRESS / REMAINING (40%)

### Documentation (High Priority)
- ⏳ Update BRD: Mark B3 Group Learning as Delivered
- ⏳ Update FSD: Add §23 Team Management & Assignments v1
- ⏳ Create runbook: `RUNBOOK_team_mgmt.md`
- ⏳ Update README files (api + root) with feature flags and routes

### Manager UI (Medium Priority - Can be Basic)
- ⏳ `/admin/teams` - List and create teams
- ⏳ `/admin/teams/:id` - Detail view with tabs (Members, Subscriptions, Overview)
- ⏳ CSV upload component with drag-drop

**Note:** User indicated to focus on functional changes first, use placeholder B2B copy for UI

### CI/CD Integration
- ⏳ Wire CI jobs for `team-mgmt.test.ts`
- ⏳ Add smoke test job to CI pipeline

### Delivery Artifacts
- ⏳ `EPIC3_DELIVERY_PROOF.md` with curl logs
- ⏳ Screenshots for UAT documentation
- ⏳ Create PR with acceptance evidence and merge

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria Status

### API
- ✅ Creating a team returns 200 JSON with id, RBAC enforced
- ✅ Adding members via JSON and CSV returns { added, skipped }, idempotent, CSRF enforced
- ✅ Subscribing a team returns 200 with subscription_id and next_due_at; emits subscription.created
- ⏳ A learner from that team receives non-empty GET /api/daily/next (requires M3 integration)
- ✅ GET /api/teams/:id/overview returns coherent counts; RBAC denies non-managers with 403
- ✅ /api/ops/kpis includes the three new counters and returns 200 with generated_at

### Non-Functional
- ✅ Migrations reversible; cold start OK
- ✅ Observability headers present (x-overview-latency-ms)
- ⏳ CI green (pending wiring)
- ⏳ Smoke script passes on staging (pending deployment)

## 🔄 Integration Points

### Epic 2 Dependencies (Met)
- ✅ Organizations table
- ✅ Users with organization_id
- ✅ RBAC middleware (requireManager, requireAdmin)
- ✅ Teams table (created in Epic 2)
- ✅ Team members table (created in Epic 2)

### Epic 4 Integration Needed
- M3 daily selector integration for `due_today` metric
- Learner queue population from team subscriptions

---

## ⚠️ Known Issues / Tech Debt

1. **Stub Metrics:**
   - `due_today` and `at_risk` in overview return 0 (stub values)
   - Need M3 integration to compute actual values

2. **Event Storage:**
   - Currently uses local `events.ndjson` file
   - Production should use durable event store

3. **Idempotency Storage:**
   - In-memory Map with 24-hour TTL
   - Production should use Redis or database

4. **CSV Parsing:**
   - Basic line-split, no header row support
   - Could enhance with proper CSV parser library

---

## 🎉 Highlights

- **Clean Architecture:** Separated concerns (routes, services, middleware)
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Unit tests + smoke tests + UAT guide
- **Idempotency:** Proper support for X-Idempotency-Key header
- **Events:** NDJSON append-only log for audit trail
- **RBAC:** Proper enforcement of admin/manager roles
- **CSV Support:** Bulk member import via text/csv content-type
- **Observability:** Latency headers, event logging, KPI tracking

## 📞 Questions for Product Owner

1. **UI Priority:** Should we complete basic Manager UI in this epic, or defer to next iteration?
2. **M3 Integration:** Should we stub `due_today`/`at_risk` metrics, or integrate with M3 now?
3. **Event Store:** Is local NDJSON acceptable for MVP, or need durable store (e.g., EventBridge)?
4. **CI Timing:** Should CI integration happen in this PR, or separate follow-up PR?

**Next Update:** After documentation completion  
**ETA to PR:** 2-4 hours (depending on UI scope)  
**Epic 3 Status:** ON TRACK ✅
