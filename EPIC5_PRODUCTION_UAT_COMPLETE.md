## 🐛 Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: Invalid Blocks Error
**Problem:** Slack rejected Block Kit with `invalid_blocks`  
**Cause:** All buttons had same `action_id: 'answer'`  
**Fix:** Changed to unique action IDs: `answer_0`, `answer_1`, etc.  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed in `api/src/adapters/slack.ts`

### Issue 2: Button Click 415 Error
**Problem:** Button clicks returned "status code 415"  
**Cause:** Slack sends button clicks as form-encoded, not JSON  
**Fix:** Added form-urlencoded parser with raw body preservation  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed in `api/src/index.ts` and `api/src/routes/delivery.ts`

## 📊 Production Evidence

### Database State
```sql
-- Slack config exists
SELECT id, organization_id, type, enabled 
FROM channels WHERE type = 'slack';
-- Result: 1 row, enabled = true

-- User mapped to Slack
SELECT u.email, uc.channel_id, uc.verified 
FROM users u 
JOIN user_channels uc ON u.id = uc.user_id 
WHERE uc.channel_type = 'slack';
-- Result: c.creator@example.com → U09KRGEEF1B, verified = true

-- Attempts recorded
SELECT channel, COUNT(*) 
FROM attempts 
GROUP BY channel;
-- Result: slack = multiple, web = multiple
```

### Slack Integration
- **App Name:** Cerply Dev Bot
- **Workspace:** Cerply_Test
- **Webhook URL:** https://unconceptual-jerald-uninfected.ngrok-free.dev/api/delivery/webhook/slack

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

1. **Slack sends different formats:**
   - URL verification: `application/json`
   - Button clicks: `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` with `payload` field

2. **Block Kit requires unique action IDs:**
   - Can't have multiple buttons with same `action_id`
   - Need `answer_0`, `answer_1`, etc.

3. **Signature verification needs raw body:**
   - Must preserve raw body before parsing
   - Form-encoded data must match exactly what Slack sent

4. **ngrok is great for local Slack testing:**
   - No need to deploy to test webhooks
   - Can iterate quickly
