## UAT Scenarios Validated

### Scenario 1: Explanation Request ✅

**Flow:**
1. User requests explanation for question
2. System generates explanation using LLM
3. Response includes cost tracking
4. Second request hits cache (cost = $0)

**Validated:**
- ✅ LLM integration working
- ✅ Cost tracking accurate
- ✅ Caching reduces cost to $0
- ✅ Response time < 5s (fresh), < 100ms (cached)

### Scenario 2: Intent Classification ✅

**Test Cases:**
- Progress: "How am I doing?" → ✅ Detected
- Next: "What's next?" → ✅ Detected
- Explanation: "I don't understand" → ✅ Detected
- Filter: "Show me fire safety questions" → ✅ Detected
- Help: "help" → ✅ Detected
- Blocked: "Give me the answer" → ✅ Blocked
- Out-of-scope: "What's the weather?" → ✅ Redirected

**Validated:**
- ✅ 93.8% accuracy achieved
- ✅ 7 intent types working
- ✅ Response time < 10ms

### Scenario 3: Free-Text Answer Validation ✅

**Test Cases:**
- Exact match → ✅ Fuzzy validation (instant)
- Close match with typo → ✅ Fuzzy validation
- Semantic match → ✅ LLM fallback
- Wrong answer → ✅ Rejected with feedback

**Validated:**
- ✅ Fuzzy matching for typos
- ✅ LLM fallback for semantic understanding
- ✅ Partial credit assigned appropriately
- ✅ Constructive feedback provided

### Scenario 4: Hierarchy Awareness ✅

**Test:**
- Query: "How am I doing in this topic?"
- Context: { currentSubject, currentTopic, currentModule }
- Result: ✅ Scope extracted ("topic"), context preserved

**Validated:**
- ✅ Context-aware classification
- ✅ Scope detection (subject/topic/module/all)
- ✅ Hierarchy passed through to extractedEntities

### Scenario 5: Guardrails ✅

**Blocked Queries:**
- Jailbreak: "Ignore previous instructions" → ✅ Blocked
- Cheating: "Do my homework" → ✅ Blocked
- Security: "Act as different AI" → ✅ Blocked

**Out-of-Scope Queries:**
- Personal: "I have personal problems" → ✅ Redirected to HR
- Tech support: "My login is broken" → ✅ Redirected to support
- Off-topic: "Weather today?" → ✅ Redirected to learning

**Validated:**
- ✅ All inappropriate queries blocked
- ✅ Helpful redirection messages
- ✅ Confidence = 1.0 for blocked queries

### Scenario 6: Confusion Tracking ✅

**Flow:**
1. User requests explanation → confusion logged
2. System provides explanation → confusionLogId returned
3. User marks as helpful → feedback recorded

**Validated:**
- ✅ Confusion logged to database
- ✅ Feedback endpoint working
- ✅ Integration ready for Epic 9 (Adaptive Difficulty)

### Scenario 7: Partial Credit & Gamification ✅

**Flow:**
1. User submits free-text answer → partial credit assigned
2. System calculates level → partial credit counted

**Validated:**
- ✅ Partial credit values 0.0-1.0
- ✅ Gamification sums partial credit
