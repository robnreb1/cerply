# Conversational Subject Refinement

## üéØ Philosophy Change

**OLD APPROACH (WRONG):**
- Detect subject ‚Üí Generate 5 topic suggestions ‚Üí Show UI widget with buttons
- Static, predetermined list
- Not adaptive to user's specific interest
- Feels like a menu, not a conversation

**NEW APPROACH (CORRECT):**
- Detect subject ‚Üí Start **guided conversational refinement**
- LLM adapts questions based on user's answers
- Multi-level narrowing: Subject ‚Üí Sub-area ‚Üí Specialization ‚Üí Topic
- Natural dialogue until we reach a focused topic
- Only then ask "Does that work for you?" and proceed to build

## üí¨ Example Flow

### Flow 1: Science ‚Üí Physics ‚Üí Astrophysics

```
User: "science"
Cerply: "I'd be happy to help with science. Are you interested in Physics, 
         Chemistry, Biology, Earth Sciences, or something else entirely?"

User: "physics"
Cerply: "Let's narrow that down a little. Would you like to explore Astrophysics, 
         Quantum Physics, Classical Mechanics, Thermodynamics, or something more specific?"

User: "astrophysics"
Cerply: "Great, so you'll be covering stellar evolution, cosmology, and the 
         physics of celestial phenomena. Does that work for you?"

User: "yes"
Cerply: "Thank you. I'm preparing your learning content now."
        "While we wait, would you like to continue with your live topics..."
```

### Flow 2: Leadership ‚Üí Team Management ‚Üí Conflict Resolution

```
User: "leadership"
Cerply: "I can help with leadership. Are you interested in Team Management, 
         Strategic Thinking, Communication Skills, or something else?"

User: "team management"
Cerply: "Let's get more specific. Would you like to focus on Conflict Resolution, 
         Delegation Skills, Team Building, or Performance Management?"

User: "conflict resolution"
Cerply: "Right, you'll learn de-escalation techniques, mediation strategies, 
         and how to turn disagreements into productive conversations. Does that work for you?"

User: "yes"
Cerply: "Thanks. I'm setting that up for you now."
```

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### 1. **Granularity Detection** (Unchanged)

**File:** `api/src/services/llm-orchestrator.ts`
- Function: `detectGranularity(input)`
- Returns: `'subject'` | `'topic'` | `'module'`
- Examples:
  - "science" ‚Üí `'subject'`
  - "physics" ‚Üí `'subject'` (still broad)
  - "astrophysics" ‚Üí `'topic'` (focused)

### 2. **Workflow Routing** (Modified)

**File:** `web/app/workflows/welcome.ts`

**Before:**
```typescript
if (granularity === 'subject') {
  // Search topics, show UI widget
  return { action: 'SHOW_TOPIC_SELECTION', data: { topicSuggestions: [...] } };
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
if (granularity === 'subject') {
  // Start conversational refinement
  return { 
    action: 'SUBJECT_REFINEMENT', 
    data: { 
      subjectName: userInput,
      refinementLevel: 'subject'
    } 
  };
}
```

### 3. **Frontend Handler** (New)

**File:** `web/app/page.tsx` (lines 380-432)

```typescript
if (transition.action === 'SUBJECT_REFINEMENT') {
  // Call conversation API with special state
  const conversationResponse = await fetch('/api/conversation', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({
      userInput: userInput,
      messageHistory: updatedState.conversationHistory,
      currentState: 'refining_subject', // NEW STATE
      originalRequest: transition.data.subjectName,
      metadata: {
        granularity: 'subject',
        refinementLevel: 'subject',
      },
    }),
  });
  
  // Display LLM's conversational response
  const convData = await conversationResponse.json();
  setMessages(prev => [...prev, { role: 'assistant', content: convData.content }]);
}
```

### 4. **Conversation Engine** (New State)

**File:** `api/src/services/conversation-engine.ts` (lines 155-192)

**Key Logic:**
```typescript
if (context.currentState === 'refining_subject') {
  const subject = context.originalRequest || userInput;
  const conversationHistory = context.messageHistory.slice(-4);
  
  userPrompt = `CONTEXT: The learner wants to learn about "${subject}" (a BROAD SUBJECT).

CONVERSATION SO FAR:
${conversationHistory}

YOUR TASK: Guide them from broad ‚Üí specific through natural conversation.

INTELLIGENT REFINEMENT STRATEGY:
1. If this is their FIRST mention of the subject:
   - Offer 3-5 MAJOR SUB-AREAS
   - Include "or something else?" at the end
   - Example: "Are you interested in Physics, Chemistry, Biology, or something else?"

2. If they've narrowed down ONCE but it's STILL broad:
   - Go ONE LEVEL DEEPER with 3-5 specializations
   - Example: "Would you like to explore Astrophysics, Quantum Physics, or something more specific?"

3. If they've narrowed down TWICE or their answer is SPECIFIC:
   - Treat it as a focused TOPIC
   - Explain what they'll learn (2-3 concrete things)
   - Ask for confirmation: "Does that work for you?"

CRITICAL RULES:
- Keep response to 2-3 sentences MAX
- Use simple, clear language
- Make it conversational, not like a menu
- Adapt options based on their interest
```

## üìù Key Differences from Previous Approach

| Aspect | OLD (UI Widget) | NEW (Conversational) |
|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Presentation** | Buttons in UI component | Natural chat messages |
| **Adaptability** | Static 5 topics | LLM adapts to user |
| **Depth** | Single level | Multi-level (2-3 rounds) |
| **User Experience** | Feels like menu | Feels like conversation |
| **Flexibility** | Predetermined topics | Handles "something else" naturally |
| **Intelligence** | DB search + template | LLM-powered guidance |
| **Tone** | Generic | Hugh Grant style |

---

## üéØ Why This Approach is Better

1. **More Helpful:** Guides user intelligently based on their specific interest
2. **More Natural:** Feels like talking to an expert advisor, not clicking through a menu
3. **More Flexible:** Handles unexpected requests ("I want to learn about X specifically")
4. **More Scalable:** Works for ANY subject without pre-generating topic lists
5. **More Intelligent:** LLM understands context and adapts questions
6. **B2B Ready:** Professional, guided experience suitable for enterprise learners
